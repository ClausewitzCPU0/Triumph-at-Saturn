14
00:01:05,096 --> 00:01:07,400
- [Narrator] In 1997, an
ambitious international mission

15
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,569
launches to Saturn that
would, for the first time,

16
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:14,440
attempt to place an orbiting
spacecraft around the planet,

17
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,078
and land a probe on a moon
in the outer solar system.

18
00:01:19,478 --> 00:01:21,780
But it was a mission
that had to fight its way

19
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,516
just to reach the launch pad.

20
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:27,053
- [Scientist] Our
Congress has had

21
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:28,821
some agony over the program.

22
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:30,556
We're gonna have
to operate under

23
00:01:30,556 --> 00:01:33,493
a very strict fund ceiling,
and an unyielding schedule.

24
00:01:34,927 --> 00:01:36,662
- [Scientist] We are all
gonna have to strive for,

25
00:01:36,662 --> 00:01:38,163
as we go through this process,

26
00:01:38,163 --> 00:01:41,568
is a continual search for the
least unacceptable solution.

27
00:01:43,202 --> 00:01:47,006
- [Narrator] The journey to
Saturn took seven long years.

28
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:49,142
And being captured
into orbit depended on

29
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:52,545
what would happen
during just three hours.

30
00:01:54,146 --> 00:01:55,647
- [Scientist] We
chased everything

31
00:01:55,647 --> 00:01:57,450
that could go wrong
down the rabbit hole.

32
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,252
We went down every path of,

33
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:01,187
if this goes wrong,
what do we do?

34
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:03,422
If that that goes
wrong, what do we do?

35
00:02:03,422 --> 00:02:05,724
- All stations on
net, SOI systems.

36
00:02:05,724 --> 00:02:07,193
Just an advisory, we're
coming up on the time

37
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:08,828
that the critical
sequence will initiate

38
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:11,431
the turn to the
SOI burn attitude.

39
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,833
- [Scientist] This was
one of those moments where

40
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:17,237
you're either in orbit, or
you're a billion dollar fly by.

41
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:20,640
- Flight, SOI comm.

42
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,840

Go ahead, SOI comm.

43
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,010

(all cheering)

45
00:02:29,615 --> 00:02:31,918
- [Narrator] With
Cassini safely in orbit,

46
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:34,654
science quickly
took center stage,

47
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,891
beginning with dazzling
images of Saturn's rings.

48
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:41,894
- [Linda] I'm surprised
at how surprised I am

49
00:02:41,894 --> 00:02:44,096
at the beauty and the
clarity of these images.

50
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,598
They are shocking to me.

51
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,836
- [Narrator] Investigating
Saturn's iconic rings

52
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,304
will be just one part of
what will turn out to be

53
00:02:52,304 --> 00:02:56,609
13 years of discoveries
about the Saturnian system.

54
00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:03,482
And what will be realized
about Saturn's moons

55
00:03:03,482 --> 00:03:07,853
will even transform how we
think about our solar system,

56
00:03:07,853 --> 00:03:09,521
and open up new pathways

57
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:11,791
for the future of
space exploration.

58
00:03:14,726 --> 00:03:16,128
- [Scientist] Around one planet,

59
00:03:16,128 --> 00:03:19,365
we find two moons
that could potentially

60
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,502
have the key ingredients
to support life.

61
00:03:23,702 --> 00:03:27,240
- [Narrator] "Triumph
at Saturn", next.

62
00:03:33,612 --> 00:03:36,783
(contemplative music)

63
00:03:40,886 --> 00:03:44,957
For some scientists, the
Saturnian moon, Titan

64
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:47,460
has been a higher
priority for exploration

65
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:51,264
than even Saturn,
or any other planet.

66
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,198
That's because
Titan may resemble

67
00:03:53,198 --> 00:03:56,803
what Earth was like
billions of years ago,

68
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,905
making this moon a
kind of time machine

69
00:03:59,905 --> 00:04:01,607
that preserves in deep freeze,

70
00:04:01,607 --> 00:04:05,278
many of the conditions that
led to life on our planet.

71
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:10,149
Titan is the only moon
in our solar system

72
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:11,851
having a dense atmosphere,

73
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:15,855
made mostly of nitrogen,
just like the Earth.

74
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:18,591
There are smaller amounts
of methane and ethane

75
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,160
that break down into
organic compounds,

76
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,064
creating the moon's
smoggy orange haze.

77
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:27,332
Titan's extremely
cold temperatures

78
00:04:27,332 --> 00:04:29,835
turn some gasses into liquids,

79
00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:33,939
which led scientists to wonder,
could Titan have oceans,

80
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:37,977
made not of water, but of
liquid methane and ethane?

81
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:41,948
These questions made
the unmasking of Titan

82
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:45,151
a major objective of the
Cassini-Huygens mission.

83
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,189
And before the release
of the Huygens probe,

84
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:52,291
Cassini would have
the first opportunity

85
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,093
to see this moon close up.

86
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:57,696
With hope sky high
that the spacecraft

87
00:04:57,696 --> 00:05:01,500
might see Titan's surface,
scientists were eager to share

88
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,538
the five hour plus flyby
live with the world.

89
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:11,677
- And you're watching
live coverage

90
00:05:11,677 --> 00:05:15,314
from the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in
Pasadena, California.

91
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:18,650
Tonight, the Cassini
spacecraft has its first

92
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,453
close encounter with
Saturn's largest

93
00:05:21,453 --> 00:05:24,357
and most intriguing moon, Titan.

94
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:27,359
This is the closest we
have ever been to Titan.

95
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:29,661
And over the next
five and a half hours,

96
00:05:29,661 --> 00:05:33,632
we hope to see the best images
we have ever seen of Titan.

97
00:05:33,632 --> 00:05:36,702
And here on NASA TV, you
will see those images

98
00:05:36,702 --> 00:05:40,305
just minutes after they
actually arrive on the ground.

99
00:05:40,305 --> 00:05:41,673
- [Narrator] And, right on cue,

100
00:05:41,673 --> 00:05:44,776
the images began streaming down.

101
00:05:44,776 --> 00:05:46,378
But it quickly became apparent

102
00:05:46,378 --> 00:05:49,482
that Titan wasn't ready
for its first closeup.

103
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:52,584
- We have just
received exciting word

104
00:05:52,584 --> 00:05:54,320
that we have the first image in.

105
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,590
- [Carolyn] Okay,
so this looks like.

106
00:05:59,191 --> 00:06:03,629
Boy, it takes a bit
of processing to
bring out features.

107
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,398
- [Narrator] What
appeared at first glance

108
00:06:06,398 --> 00:06:09,168
to be black and white
smudges left scientists

109
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:12,238
and viewers alike puzzled
as to what they were seeing.

110
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,042
- [Carolyn] Look at
that, look at that.

111
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:18,578
And we don't know what it is.

112
00:06:21,213 --> 00:06:24,182
- Anything stand out in
your mind at this point?

113
00:06:24,182 --> 00:06:27,053
- Yeah, it's been a
very strange evening.

114
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,888
If you put me against
a wall and said

115
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,322
what's cloud and
what isn't cloud,

116
00:06:30,322 --> 00:06:31,791
I really couldn't tell you.

117
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,559
I assume that much of
this is surface features.

118
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:37,530
Yeah, these are low contrast.

119
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,699
I'm not really sure what
we're looking at here.

120
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:43,268
- [Gay] With us now
is Torrance Johnson,

121
00:06:43,268 --> 00:06:45,071
one of the imaging scientists to

122
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,474
kind of give us the
overall, what does it mean?

123
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,077
- Well, I think first off,

124
00:06:52,077 --> 00:06:53,945
the main thing that
tonight's meant for us

125
00:06:53,945 --> 00:06:56,649
is we've had a very
successful encounter.

126
00:06:56,649 --> 00:07:00,820
We're really looking at a
great haul of data here.

127
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,122
And, well, you saw some
of the stuff coming in.

128
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:05,657
There's clearly stuff to be
seen there on that surface.

129
00:07:05,657 --> 00:07:08,394
Understanding it's
a different issue.

130
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:12,064
And one of the things that
all of us on the project

131
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:13,932
have been talking
about for a long time,

132
00:07:13,932 --> 00:07:16,903
is this sort of cooperative
science approach.

133
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:19,905
We knew Titan was
a tough target,

134
00:07:19,905 --> 00:07:22,475
it was going to hold
its secrets tightly.

135
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:26,044
And so we designed this
mission, and the experiments,

136
00:07:26,044 --> 00:07:27,613
to hit it with
everything we've got.

137
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,482
This is our first chance
to do that, really.

138
00:07:30,482 --> 00:07:33,953
We're really gonna have to do
a full up complete body scan

139
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,955
of Titan to figure
out what's going on.

140
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:40,693
- [Narrator] This
encounter confirmed

141
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:44,230
that Titan would be as
complex as it was obscure.

142
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:50,002
Fortunately, there are many
more Cassini flybys still ahead.

143
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:54,106
But next up to explore Titan
is the European Space Agency's

144
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:56,842
Huygens Probe, that
will try to descend

145
00:07:56,842 --> 00:07:59,111
all the way to the
moon's surface.

146
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,648
- The procedure here
is pretty standard.

147
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,750
We're gonna follow
right through the MOP.

148
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,720
The idea is a series
of brief reports.

149
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,923
- [Narrator] Eight
weeks have passed,

150
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:13,626
and it is the Eve of
Christmas Eve, as leaders of

151
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:17,596
the Cassini-Huygens team
hold a go, no-go meeting

152
00:08:17,596 --> 00:08:20,899
on whether to release
the Huygens Probe.

153
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:23,502
- We had two opportunities
to update this,

154
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:24,769
one at the Titan's flyby.

155
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:25,971
- [Narrator] There are no known

156
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:27,973
technical issues with
which to contend,

157
00:08:27,973 --> 00:08:31,243
making this meeting
mostly a formality.

158
00:08:31,243 --> 00:08:34,111
- Navigation has flown
a precision trajectory.

159
00:08:34,111 --> 00:08:37,081
So there was no need for
us to make any updates.

160
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:39,116
- Tracking data has been
absolutely excellent lately.

161
00:08:39,116 --> 00:08:41,786
DSN is doing a really good job.

162
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:44,190
And Julie's team has
done a marvelous job.

163
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,692
She has given us recently,
really great news.

164
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,730
- Yeah, don't. Don't
jinx it, Jerry.

165
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,165
(all laughing)

166
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,100
- I'm just racing by.

167
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,834
There go the pagers.

168
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:59,739
- I know, yeah. As I jump,
'cause the pager goes off.

169
00:09:03,074 --> 00:09:04,643
- Based on what we've heard here

170
00:09:04,643 --> 00:09:07,179
from the representatives, and
the people that did the work,

171
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:10,315
it's very clear
that the orbiter,

172
00:09:10,315 --> 00:09:14,353
JPL part of this team
is ready to proceed.

173
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,091
- The probe team is
also ready to go.

174
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:22,161
We are green for
tomorrow. So let's go.

175
00:09:24,696 --> 00:09:26,599
- Okay, well let me just add

176
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:31,070
my enormous thanks from
the European side for the

177
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,773
terrific collaborative
effort on the US side.

178
00:09:34,773 --> 00:09:37,276
It's just been great
to be working with you.

179
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:41,213
And I think we're all very
appreciative, and so let's go.

180
00:09:42,514 --> 00:09:45,251
- Okay. We are a
go. You're good.

181
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,853
(all clapping)

182
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:51,824
- [Narrator] Southwood's
remarks were heartfelt,

183
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,860
as four years earlier,
the mission had faced

184
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,130
what seemed an
unsolvable problem,

185
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,766
a design flaw found
on Huygens' receiver

186
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,035
located on the
Cassini spacecraft.

187
00:10:04,169 --> 00:10:06,305
An in-flight test
revealed the receiver

188
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:09,274
was incapable of adjusting
to Doppler shifts,

189
00:10:09,274 --> 00:10:11,444
changes in radio frequencies.

190
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:17,183
That would leave Huygens'
data nearly worthless.

191
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:22,655
A major fix required
a hands-on solution,

192
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:26,125
impossible to do with the
probe a billion miles away.

193
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:30,129
Knowing little could
be done to Huygens,

194
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,564
the best hope
rested with Cassini.

195
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:34,199
When mission planners realized

196
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:36,702
that adjustments to the
spacecraft's trajectory

197
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:39,372
could minimize radio
frequency changes.

198
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:45,076
This required Cassini to
fly higher above Titan,

199
00:10:45,076 --> 00:10:49,014
and at a relatively
slower speed, which
would allow the data

200
00:10:49,014 --> 00:10:52,018
to be accurately recorded
as the probe descended.

201
00:10:53,685 --> 00:10:56,488
But this solution was not free.

202
00:10:56,488 --> 00:10:59,625
It would cost Cassini a
quarter of its reserve fuel.

203
00:11:02,494 --> 00:11:05,197
This sacrifice confirmed
that Cassini-Huygens

204
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:08,467
was truly an
international partnership.

205
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,603
For without this decision,

206
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:14,106
Huygens was assured of being
seen as a failed mission.

207
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,045
The crisis was
now only a memory,

208
00:11:20,045 --> 00:11:23,481
and it was now time for the
probe to detach from Cassini

209
00:11:23,481 --> 00:11:25,951
to begin its dangerous
descent into Titan.

210
00:11:35,627 --> 00:11:37,062
- [Julie] All station's are in.

211
00:11:37,062 --> 00:11:39,532
Flight Director, we're
gonna do a final call here.

212
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,965
- [Narrator]
There's a JPL saying

213
00:11:40,965 --> 00:11:43,635
that for some celestial reason,

214
00:11:43,635 --> 00:11:46,939
major mission events always
seem to happen on holidays,

215
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:50,943
weekends, late at night, or
a combination of the three.

216
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:55,981
The probe's release is
no exception to the rule.

217
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,649
It is Christmas Eve.

218
00:11:57,649 --> 00:12:00,219
- I'd like to start the
poll in five minutes.

219
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,455
- [Narrator] On hand
to show their support

220
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:07,058
for the Cassini team are
leaders of the Huygens probe,

221
00:12:07,058 --> 00:12:10,963
JPL Director, Charles Elachi,

222
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:13,766
Caltech President,
David Baltimore.

223
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:16,535
And arriving just
in the nick of time,

224
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:19,471
JPL veteran, Tom Gavin,

225
00:12:19,471 --> 00:12:23,641
whose job title includes
the phrase mission success.

226
00:12:23,641 --> 00:12:25,143
- Nothing like cutting it close.

227
00:12:25,143 --> 00:12:26,645
We already lost signal.

228
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:29,115
- Well, I knew you
had it under control.

229
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:31,316
(laughing)

230
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:33,285
- He came for when we
receive see the signal.

231
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:36,154
That's the important part.

232
00:12:36,154 --> 00:12:37,756
- When will they acquire
signal, do you think?

233
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,759
- [Julie] Earliest
carrier lock is 7:29.

234
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:44,363
(dramatic music)

235
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,676
(voices overlapping)

236
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:59,778
(all cheering)

237
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,179
- Released, all three.

238
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:04,850
(all cheering and clapping)

239
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:10,489
- Okay, you're on your
own now, you know?

240
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:14,226
(high school band music)

241
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:16,761
- [Narrator] With the
Huygens probe now on its own,

242
00:13:16,761 --> 00:13:20,966
silently free falling to
Titan for the next 21 days,

243
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,136
the Cassini team can relax
and enjoy the holidays,

244
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,939
especially New Year's Day.

245
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,576
That was because JPL
was sponsoring a float

246
00:13:31,576 --> 00:13:34,145
in the Pasadena
Tournament of Roses Parade

247
00:13:34,145 --> 00:13:36,749
for only the third time
in the lab's history.

248
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:43,288
The float featured
nine JPL missions.

249
00:13:43,288 --> 00:13:45,991
The one at the top was Cassini.

250
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:50,329
(high school band
music continues)

251
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:56,435
(dramatic music)

252
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:09,715
The Huygens dive into Titan

253
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:12,351
is the most distant
landing ever attempted.

254
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:17,155
The descent through
the atmosphere

255
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:19,625
is expected to take
more than two hours.

256
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:24,229
The hope is that the
probe's batteries

257
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:26,599
will last long enough
to reach the surface.

258
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:30,202
What it will be like,
no one really knows.

259
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:35,140
Because there could be
lakes or seas of methane,

260
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,209
the probe has been
designed to float.

261
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,550
But first Huygens has to survive

262
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,785
the plunge through
Titan's atmosphere.

263
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,694
The entry speed is more
than 12,000 miles per hour.

264
00:14:57,729 --> 00:15:01,800
Soon temperatures are soaring
over 3000 degrees Fahrenheit.

265
00:15:03,301 --> 00:15:05,336
If the heat shield does its job,

266
00:15:05,336 --> 00:15:09,007
the science instruments inside
the probe will have no idea

267
00:15:09,007 --> 00:15:12,311
there is an inferno taking
place just inches away.

268
00:15:26,024 --> 00:15:29,495
After surviving the initial
phase of the descent,

269
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:32,031
the first of three
parachutes deploys.

270
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:43,241
Nearer the surface, the
winds begin to calm,

271
00:15:43,241 --> 00:15:46,011
and Titan's orange
haze begins to clear,

272
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:50,249
revealing below a
surreal landscape.

273
00:15:55,687 --> 00:15:59,257
- So imagine descending
down through a misty,

274
00:15:59,257 --> 00:16:01,860
cloudy atmosphere,
and suddenly below you

275
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:06,031
breaks this vista of
this very bright hill

276
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:09,835
with channels that
are carved by liquid,

277
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:12,170
with rounded pebbles
that were evidently

278
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,105
rolled and tumbled by liquid.

279
00:16:14,105 --> 00:16:15,741
That was what the
Huygens probe saw.

280
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,076
And it showed us
that methane not only

281
00:16:18,076 --> 00:16:20,178
is in the atmosphere,
but has been

282
00:16:20,178 --> 00:16:23,181
raining and producing
weather, and carving features

283
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:25,751
in the landscape for
long periods of time.

284
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:29,755
(suspenseful music)

285
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:39,264
(loud crash)

286
00:16:40,665 --> 00:16:43,369
- [Narrator] As Huygens
lands in a triumphant plop,

287
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:44,670
history is made.

288
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:49,241
And better yet, the probe's
batteries are still working.

289
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:54,546
What Huygens sees seems to
resemble a dried up riverbed.

290
00:16:57,482 --> 00:17:00,318
Right in front are rocks
made of frozen water,

291
00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:01,720
harder than stone.

292
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,759
There are no signs
of lakes or seas.

293
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,395
But Huygens view is
only a single spot

294
00:17:10,395 --> 00:17:12,865
on a moon larger than
the planet Mercury.

295
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,468
The global reconnaissance
will come from Cassini.

296
00:17:24,509 --> 00:17:27,311
On many of Cassini's
orbits around Saturn,

297
00:17:27,311 --> 00:17:30,014
the spacecraft will
fly near Titan,

298
00:17:30,014 --> 00:17:32,817
allowing navigators
to use the moon's mass

299
00:17:32,817 --> 00:17:34,252
to alter trajectories,

300
00:17:34,252 --> 00:17:36,655
while at the same
time, conserving fuel.

301
00:17:38,156 --> 00:17:41,059
These flybys are also
opportunities to use

302
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:44,262
Cassini's powerful radar
to penetrate through

303
00:17:44,262 --> 00:17:46,932
swaths of the moon's
hazy atmosphere.

304
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,870
The radio waves that bounce
back from Titan's surface

305
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,274
can be turned by scientists
into topographical maps.

306
00:17:56,775 --> 00:18:01,780
Piece by piece, swath by
swath, Titan is revealed.

307
00:18:03,081 --> 00:18:04,583
- Let's start at the
beginning and run to the end,

308
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,751
and just see what
interesting things we see.

309
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:09,354
And maybe you can point out the
things that you've seen too.

310
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:10,589
- [Carolyn] Okay.

311
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,091
Here is the new swath as
it comes through here.

312
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:15,293
- Titan really is, in some ways,

313
00:18:15,293 --> 00:18:17,195
a kind of a cosmic
striptease act.

314
00:18:17,195 --> 00:18:20,098
Because we can't
see the surface in

315
00:18:20,098 --> 00:18:23,101
the normal wavelengths
that our eyes would use.

316
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:26,738
And the radar operates by
making images in narrow strips.

317
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:29,407
And so strip by strip
in different places,

318
00:18:29,407 --> 00:18:30,775
Titan has been unveiled.

319
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:32,577
- [Carolyn] Here,
can everyone see?

320
00:18:32,577 --> 00:18:34,379
- In that slide, you
can see a feature

321
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:38,317
that runs almost perpendicular
to the altimetry track.

322
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,385
- [Carolyn] So we see the
end of the dunes here.

323
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,487
Then you see the
dunes peter out.

324
00:18:42,487 --> 00:18:45,857
And it gets brighter,
which is interesting, here.

325
00:18:45,857 --> 00:18:50,128
- [Narrator] Massive dunes
are seen, made not of sand,

326
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:52,965
but of organic molecules
containing carbon.

327
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:56,067
- From the email
traffic last night,

328
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:58,470
I sorta gathered nobody
sees a magic island

329
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,139
in the data that
we have, correct?

330
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:02,474
- [Torrence] I think
that's correct.

331
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,708
- [Earl] Tell you what,

332
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,277
you all just zoom in on
the beginning of that.

333
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:08,747
- [Narrator] A large dark basin

334
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:11,283
turns out to be a
lake full of methane.

335
00:19:12,984 --> 00:19:15,153
It is the first of
hundreds of deep lakes

336
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:16,688
and seas that will be found.

337
00:19:18,189 --> 00:19:20,725
- [Scientist] Most of your
observation of this lake,

338
00:19:20,725 --> 00:19:24,129
they show a top
surface reflection.

339
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:28,366
So the depth of this particular
lake is about 100 meters,

340
00:19:28,366 --> 00:19:31,069
as we can see from
the axis of the image.

341
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,404
- Is it right to get out of
this that the small lakes

342
00:19:33,404 --> 00:19:37,042
don't seem to be any shallower
than the larger lakes?

343
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,245
- [Narrator] Titan's
strangest discovery

344
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:42,548
is a continent sized
area named Xanadu.

345
00:19:44,348 --> 00:19:46,551
Here are canyons and mountains

346
00:19:46,551 --> 00:19:49,054
that resemble no other
place on this moon.

347
00:19:51,589 --> 00:19:55,494
It is as if, one scientist
said, it's from another world.

348
00:19:56,961 --> 00:19:58,162
- [Scientist] One thing,

349
00:19:58,162 --> 00:20:00,032
just to make a quick
comment, is that

350
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,535
I am always very impressed
by the radar planning team.

351
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,337
They absolutely got it
right on the bullseye.

352
00:20:06,337 --> 00:20:09,441
'Cause this is a long way away,

353
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:11,309
flying by at
kilometers per second.

354
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:13,679
And they put it right on
the bullseye. Nice job.

355
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:17,682
- [Narrator] Titan may
even have volcanoes

356
00:20:17,682 --> 00:20:22,220
that gush out an icy mixture
of water and other materials.

357
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:26,057
And this water comes
from a hidden ocean

358
00:20:26,057 --> 00:20:27,826
beneath Titan's icy shell.

359
00:20:32,697 --> 00:20:34,666
And whenever water is mentioned,

360
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,703
it's not long before
the question is raised.

361
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:41,206
Is this a place that could
possibly support life?

362
00:20:42,607 --> 00:20:45,243
- Giant Titan, the size
of the planet, Mercury,

363
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:49,614
has a global liquid water
ocean underneath its icy crust,

364
00:20:49,614 --> 00:20:53,719
as well as methane lakes
and seas at the north pole.

365
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:56,988
And we wonder, could those
methane lakes and seas

366
00:20:56,988 --> 00:20:59,057
support different kind of life?

367
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,928
So that's really
opened our eyes.

368
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:08,032
- [Narrator] There's still
more that was discovered.

369
00:21:08,032 --> 00:21:11,469
This moon has
weather, and seasons.

370
00:21:11,469 --> 00:21:15,106
Here it rains, not
water, but methane

371
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:16,742
that floats down like snow.

372
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:21,245
- It's so Earth-like, that
this is a very familiar place.

373
00:21:21,245 --> 00:21:23,281
The chemistry in the atmosphere

374
00:21:23,281 --> 00:21:25,884
is much more complex
than expected.

375
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:30,789
And the system as a whole is
just as intricate as Earth,

376
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,958
in terms of the atmosphere
interacting with the surface,

377
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,128
and the materials
on the surface.

378
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:38,329
Titan has a methane cycle,

379
00:21:38,329 --> 00:21:39,964
just like Earth
has a water cycle.

380
00:21:39,964 --> 00:21:42,433
And being able to
watch that in action,

381
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:44,635
seeing the lakes on the surface,

382
00:21:44,635 --> 00:21:46,938
the channels that have been
carved into the surface,

383
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:49,974
and then actually seeing clouds
forming in the atmosphere,

384
00:21:49,974 --> 00:21:52,510
and rain, the effect
of rain on the surface.

385
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,746
That whole cycle has
been one of the things

386
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:56,715
that's been absolutely
spectacular.

387
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,527
(calm music)

388
00:22:15,433 --> 00:22:17,435
- [Narrator] Saturn's
moon, Enceladus,

389
00:22:17,435 --> 00:22:20,539
was also a target of special
interest for Cassini.

390
00:22:23,441 --> 00:22:27,179
It is the most reflective object
in the entire solar system.

391
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,881
And a great mystery
was why this moon

392
00:22:30,881 --> 00:22:32,851
seemed to have so few craters.

393
00:22:33,951 --> 00:22:35,720
Theories abounded.

394
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,788
Might there be some
internal heat source

395
00:22:37,788 --> 00:22:39,357
that melts ice on the surface,

396
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:41,626
which then fills in the holes?

397
00:22:42,827 --> 00:22:44,395
Could volcanoes or geysers

398
00:22:44,395 --> 00:22:46,531
account for the
moon's shiny facade?

399
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:51,903
Or was Enceladus just a
dead, airless ball of ice?

400
00:22:55,072 --> 00:22:57,209
Cassini would find the answer,

401
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,612
sending shock waves through
the scientific community,

402
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:03,080
all of it brought about
by one of the spacecraft's

403
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,150
least known science instruments,

404
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,220
the spacecraft's magnetometer.

405
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,123
It's a kind of high-tech compass

406
00:23:12,123 --> 00:23:15,293
that makes measurements
of magnetic fields.

407
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:17,562
It's so sensitive that
it can even detect

408
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,832
the spacecraft's own
magnetic emissions.

409
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,634
To cancel out those
unwanted signals,

410
00:23:23,634 --> 00:23:25,170
this instrument was marooned

411
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,839
out on the end of
Cassini's long boom.

412
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,776
On this flyby no
one was expecting

413
00:23:31,776 --> 00:23:34,546
there would be much from
the lonely instrument.

414
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:39,117
- I must confess we weren't
expecting to see anything.

415
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:42,420
And so we didn't look at the
data for a couple of days.

416
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,990
And then when we went in
and looked at the data,

417
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:50,295
only magnetometer people
can get excited by our data.

418
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:52,830
'Cause you sort of
plotted on it on a scale

419
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,265
where you look at the whole day.

420
00:23:54,265 --> 00:23:58,269
And we had to look at
the wiggles on the plot,

421
00:23:58,269 --> 00:24:00,205
and they looked strange.

422
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:03,375
- The expectation was that
Saturn's magnetic field

423
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,976
would extend straight out,

424
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:07,312
and flow directly
through Enceladus.

425
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:12,184
Instead, the magnetic field
was curving around the moon.

426
00:24:13,684 --> 00:24:15,420
There were also unexpected signs

427
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,556
of ionized water
vapor molecules.

428
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:22,293
These were measurements that
could be translated into sounds

429
00:24:22,293 --> 00:24:26,798
as the spacecraft approached
and departed from Enceladus.

430
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,035
(high pitched whining)

431
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:38,710
- And so it was clear that

432
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,712
there was a source
of water group ions

433
00:24:41,712 --> 00:24:44,148
in the vicinity of Enceladus.

434
00:24:44,148 --> 00:24:45,617
And in addition to that,

435
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:48,252
there was something strange
going on in the magnetic field.

436
00:24:48,252 --> 00:24:52,223
And it looked as if Enceladus
was a much bigger obstacle

437
00:24:52,223 --> 00:24:54,959
to the flow of plasma and
field coming from Saturn.

438
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:58,062
It was almost as if the
magnetic field of Saturn,

439
00:24:58,062 --> 00:25:00,164
and the plasma of Saturn
were being stood off

440
00:25:00,164 --> 00:25:02,334
from the surface of the moon.

441
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,969
- [Narrator] Unsure of
the accuracy of the data,

442
00:25:04,969 --> 00:25:06,638
Dougherty and her team awaited

443
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:09,441
the results of a
second, closer flyby.

444
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:14,645
- And I must confess. We looked
at that data straight away.

445
00:25:14,645 --> 00:25:16,247
We were a little concerned about

446
00:25:16,247 --> 00:25:17,949
the calibration
of the instrument.

447
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:23,120
But that there seemed to
be something in the data,

448
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:28,126
which was pointing
to an atmospheric
signature of some kind.

449
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,494
And at that stage,
we were talking about

450
00:25:30,494 --> 00:25:32,130
an atmosphere covering
the entire surface.

451
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:37,635
- [Narrator] Not everyone
on Dougherty's team agreed.

452
00:25:37,635 --> 00:25:40,571
For one thing, tiny Enceladus
lacks enough gravity

453
00:25:40,571 --> 00:25:42,507
to hold an atmosphere in place.

454
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:48,346
In hopes of solving the
mystery, Dougherty proposed

455
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:51,816
flying even closer to
Enceladus on the next flyby.

456
00:25:52,683 --> 00:25:54,452
Doing so would upset trajectory

457
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:57,255
and science plans
long ago mapped out,

458
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:59,991
but Dougherty's
argument won the day.

459
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,493
Navigators plotted out
a new course that sent

460
00:26:02,493 --> 00:26:06,131
Cassini skimming just over
100 miles above the moon.

461
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,936
- For the couple of
nights before that flyby,

462
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,603
I didn't sleep.

463
00:26:12,603 --> 00:26:14,339
What happened if we had
seen nothing at all?

464
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:17,474
No one would ever have
believed anything I said again.

465
00:26:17,474 --> 00:26:19,310
And I didn't sleep well at all.

466
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:23,148
But then we got the data
back. And it was spectacular.

467
00:26:24,315 --> 00:26:25,817
- [Narrator] In the
Southern polar region,

468
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:28,819
Cassini found the
landscape free of craters,

469
00:26:28,819 --> 00:26:32,023
yet littered with house
sized boulders of ice,

470
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:34,392
carved out along
blueish trenches

471
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:37,462
that scientists dubbed
"tiger stripes".

472
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:44,134
The moon would no longer
be known for being smooth.

473
00:26:44,134 --> 00:26:46,804
Here was a fractured surface,

474
00:26:46,804 --> 00:26:50,642
containing crisscrossing
faults, folds, and ridges.

475
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:54,646
These crevices tell us

476
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:57,382
that Enceladus is
geologically alive.

477
00:26:57,382 --> 00:27:00,217
(dramatic music)

478
00:27:00,217 --> 00:27:03,020
From these fissures,
more than a mile deep,

479
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,588
geysers are erupting.

480
00:27:04,588 --> 00:27:07,425
(geyser erupting)

481
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:13,130
Nicknamed Cold Faithful, they
are continuously spraying out

482
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:16,434
massive jets of ice
particles and water vapor.

483
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:23,107
(geysers continue erupting)

484
00:27:23,107 --> 00:27:26,210
The speculation for more
than a decade before,

485
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:28,112
that the shiny
surface of Enceladus

486
00:27:28,112 --> 00:27:32,316
might be the result
of ice vulcanism,
turned out to be true.

487
00:27:32,316 --> 00:27:33,951
A momentous discovery

488
00:27:33,951 --> 00:27:36,988
that began with unusual
wiggles on a chart.

489
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:41,426
- I thought, okay.

490
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:44,396
My reputation is saved. They're
not gonna think I'm crazy.

491
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:48,766
But also, it made
me feel really proud

492
00:27:48,766 --> 00:27:51,169
of what magnetometer
instruments can do.

493
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,570
Because in some ways,

494
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,173
because we're just
wiggly data on a plot,

495
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:59,477
it's very hard to get
people enthused by our data.

496
00:28:00,377 --> 00:28:02,146
You sorta media guys as well.

497
00:28:02,146 --> 00:28:04,182
It's really difficult
to enthuse you.

498
00:28:06,884 --> 00:28:09,620
- [Narrator] The detection
of geysers was stunning,

499
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,889
for it meant the
existence of liquid water

500
00:28:11,889 --> 00:28:14,626
near the surface of
this bitterly cold moon.

501
00:28:22,066 --> 00:28:24,536
And that turned
Enceladus, in an instant,

502
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,238
into a prime target for the
remainder of the mission.

503
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,979
Previous plans
were tossed aside,

504
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:38,282
in favor of adding
more Enceladus flybys,

505
00:28:38,282 --> 00:28:41,986
including dramatic plunges
through the plumes.

506
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:44,823
(dramatic music)

507
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:52,963
- What is that?

508
00:28:52,963 --> 00:28:55,867
And look at this little thing
here, this circular feature.

509
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,237
It's so complex.

510
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,738
The question is,

511
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:03,041
are both of them coming
out of the tiger stripes?

512
00:29:04,475 --> 00:29:06,945
Be nice to get a temperature
measurement right on that.

513
00:29:08,178 --> 00:29:11,649
Look at that. It looks
almost like a river.

514
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:13,117
But see that's in shadow,

515
00:29:13,117 --> 00:29:15,920
but we can still see because
the moon is so bright.

516
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,889
But there's so much
multiple scattering.

517
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:24,262
- [Narrator] Enceladus is
as small as it is bright.

518
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:30,201
This small, when compared
to Earth and our moon.

519
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:33,371
Given its diminutive size,
it was thought Enceladus

520
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:36,374
would have long ago
lost any interior heat.

521
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:43,514
And what, scientists wondered,

522
00:29:43,514 --> 00:29:47,552
was causing Enceladus' plumes
to spray out these hot spots?

523
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:53,124
The answer involves Saturn's
massive tidal forces.

524
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:56,393
They create friction
inside the moon's interior,

525
00:29:56,393 --> 00:29:58,696
where there exists
an ocean of water,

526
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:00,365
a tremendous discovery.

527
00:30:01,565 --> 00:30:04,368
And liquid from this
ocean Wells upward,

528
00:30:04,368 --> 00:30:06,371
creating the moon's hotspots,

529
00:30:08,338 --> 00:30:10,241
and the geysers that vent out.

530
00:30:15,546 --> 00:30:18,148
And from these plumes,
scientists discovered

531
00:30:18,148 --> 00:30:20,417
that the moon's
ocean contains salts

532
00:30:20,417 --> 00:30:23,421
and complex organic molecules,

533
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:26,691
likely created by
hydrothermal vents,

534
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:29,760
the exact conditions
believed to have given rise

535
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,795
to life on Earth.

536
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,168
For many, these discoveries
about this tiny moon

537
00:30:38,168 --> 00:30:40,004
was Cassini's biggest triumph.

538
00:30:41,405 --> 00:30:45,176
For Enceladus is now one of
the most promising destinations

539
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:48,346
to search for life elsewhere
in our solar system.

540
00:31:06,296 --> 00:31:10,033
Cassini's discoveries during
the first four years at Saturn

541
00:31:10,033 --> 00:31:12,337
raised new questions to answer.

542
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:17,141
With the spacecraft
in excellent health,

543
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:19,677
NASA twice extended
the mission's funding.

544
00:31:22,346 --> 00:31:24,482
Over the course of 13 years,

545
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:28,820
the spacecraft orbited
Saturn 294 times.

546
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,788
No two orbits were alike.

547
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:35,193
Determining the pathways
for these intricate loops

548
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:38,029
is the work of true
rocket scientists.

549
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:41,199
Or as they are called,
tour designers.

550
00:31:42,099 --> 00:31:43,868
They are mathematical wizards

551
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:46,671
who charted courses through
the maze of Saturn's

552
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:49,607
80 plus moons and
its ring system.

553
00:31:51,275 --> 00:31:52,876
- Tour should be
ranked green if it's-

554
00:31:52,876 --> 00:31:54,278
- [Narrator] That
is half of the job

555
00:31:54,278 --> 00:31:56,581
of these three tour designers.

556
00:31:56,581 --> 00:32:00,418
The other half, trying
to please 200 scientists.

557
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,653
- This tour is
probably a yellow.

558
00:32:02,653 --> 00:32:03,821
'Cause I hate to keep

559
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:05,456
having this email
exchange back and forth.

560
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:06,925
It looks bad, I think.

561
00:32:08,091 --> 00:32:10,628
We're taking in all the
science requirements,

562
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:13,630
which are, you know, could
be a stack that thick.

563
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:16,367
We're kind of like a tour
guide bringing a big group

564
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:19,470
of kids, or scientists,
to Disneyland.

565
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,738
And the only problem is,

566
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:22,506
we have to stick
together as a group.

567
00:32:22,506 --> 00:32:24,742
We all have to do
the same thing.

568
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:29,246
And it's again, trying to
please everyone equally,

569
00:32:29,246 --> 00:32:32,917
or as my old supervisor
said, equally unhappy.

570
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:34,919
If everyone's equally
unhappy by the end

571
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:38,156
of the tour selection process,
then we've done our job.

572
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,892
- You can see that
all of the tours have

573
00:32:41,892 --> 00:32:44,696
a large number of Southern
hemisphere coverage.

574
00:32:46,563 --> 00:32:48,866
- We have evaluated the nominal

575
00:32:50,233 --> 00:32:52,269
tours that came out last week.

576
00:32:52,269 --> 00:32:55,272
Any modifications are things
that we're gonna have to

577
00:32:55,272 --> 00:32:57,275
grapple with as a
group this week.

578
00:32:57,275 --> 00:33:01,045
We can't have an input
that's a mix of the two,

579
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:03,948
unless we all understand
all of the implications.

580
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:06,351
- [Earl] Hey, guys. Can
I interrupt for a minute?

581
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:08,519
- They debate it out.
They listen to each other.

582
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,120
It gets heated at times.

583
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,990
- Is that a reasonable approach?

584
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,825
- [Candice] That's what I
would. I would like to say.

585
00:33:14,825 --> 00:33:16,360
- But I have an objection.

586
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,964
Are we making the right
choice for the right reasons?

587
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:21,165
- Well, that's.

588
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,201
Every team is gonna have
to think about that.

589
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:25,302
Because we're not
gonna do the allocation

590
00:33:25,302 --> 00:33:27,404
until after the
tour is selected.

591
00:33:27,404 --> 00:33:30,207
So, in a sense you
are taking that risk.

592
00:33:30,207 --> 00:33:31,776
- It can be very frustrating
at first because,

593
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:34,478
in one meeting someone say,
well do A, you gotta do A.

594
00:33:34,478 --> 00:33:36,880
And in the next meeting they'll
say, oh, you can't do that.

595
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,582
You have to do this instead.

596
00:33:38,582 --> 00:33:40,651
- Just a strategic comment.

597
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:43,086
I think everybody in this
room knows how rushed

598
00:33:43,086 --> 00:33:44,421
the evaluations
for all these were,

599
00:33:44,421 --> 00:33:46,390
because they came in so late.

600
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:49,060
- It starts out everybody's
on different ends,

601
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:52,029
sometimes yelling, sometimes
red faced, really mad.

602
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:54,298
Like they're really trying
to make sure they get heard.

603
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:55,966
- The tour designers
have been looking at

604
00:33:55,966 --> 00:33:58,035
what is the flexibility,

605
00:33:58,035 --> 00:34:03,041
in a given tour to raise
and lower the altitude?

606
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:05,575
We have to look at
the ripple effect.

607
00:34:05,575 --> 00:34:07,978
- When you're up high,
out of the orbit plane,

608
00:34:07,978 --> 00:34:09,280
you're up way above Saturn,

609
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,514
you get a good
view of the rings.

610
00:34:10,514 --> 00:34:12,750
But you're not around
any of the other moons.

611
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,217
And so the people that
want to look at the rings

612
00:34:14,217 --> 00:34:16,253
want to be up high,
and look at the rings.

613
00:34:16,253 --> 00:34:17,487
The other people want to be down

614
00:34:17,487 --> 00:34:19,155
in the same plane
with the rings,

615
00:34:19,156 --> 00:34:20,924
where they can visit
all the other moons.

616
00:34:20,924 --> 00:34:22,626
And that's a huge tug of war.

617
00:34:22,626 --> 00:34:25,396
You know, it's such that the
JQ perturbations are maximized.

618
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,931
- [Scientist] What
you're hearing here,

619
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:28,364
and I said it earlier,

620
00:34:28,364 --> 00:34:29,599
what are you hearing
from people in this room.

621
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,569
They haven't had
a chance to really

622
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:35,039
evaluate the
information in a way,

623
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:38,141
well enough so they think
we've got the right decision.

624
00:34:38,141 --> 00:34:39,375
So I think-

625
00:34:39,376 --> 00:34:41,478
- We had went through
the stressful times

626
00:34:41,478 --> 00:34:42,912
earlier in the week,

627
00:34:42,913 --> 00:34:45,650
meeting with each discipline
working group, 'cause

628
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,684
we sit in front of these,

629
00:34:47,684 --> 00:34:51,021
40 or 50 world renowned
scientists in a specific field.

630
00:34:51,021 --> 00:34:52,657
And it's kind of like a
Congressional hearing,

631
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:55,826
where they just fire off
questions one after the other.

632
00:34:55,826 --> 00:34:57,962
And you really have
to know your stuff,

633
00:34:57,962 --> 00:35:01,866
and understand every
idiosyncrasy of
each specific tour.

634
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:03,100
- But after they
got heard, I mean,

635
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,602
people kind of calmed
down a little bit.

636
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:05,902
But eventually
everybody agrees, yeah,

637
00:35:05,902 --> 00:35:07,171
that's kind of the best thing.

638
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:09,173
So we're very lucky
that the spacecraft

639
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:12,343
is very highly functional,
and we have a lot of fuel.

640
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:14,479
All the tours are good.

641
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:16,947
And I'd feel happy if
any of them got selected.

642
00:35:16,947 --> 00:35:19,417
I mean, all of them are
gonna be really exciting.

643
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:24,087
I mean, just. I mean,
just amazing pictures.

644
00:35:24,087 --> 00:35:25,322
It's almost like
we have Ansel Adams

645
00:35:25,322 --> 00:35:26,591
riding on the spacecraft.

646
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:30,861
I'm talking about
pictures, but I mean

647
00:35:30,861 --> 00:35:33,430
the other stuff is neat too.

648
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:34,564
I mean, some of
these instruments,

649
00:35:34,564 --> 00:35:36,367
they can just take a picture.

650
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:39,036
And they can tell you
what it's made out of.

651
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:40,738
It's like some sort
of Star Trek thing.

652
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:43,140
But really, Star Trek didn't
have instruments this cool.

653
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,742
They just had this green ray.

654
00:35:45,742 --> 00:35:46,910
And it did everything, right?

655
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:47,944
They're tri-corder or whatever.

656
00:35:47,944 --> 00:35:49,413
Or they really amazing stuff,

657
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:52,583
is when they find stuff it's
like, they have no idea.

658
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:54,652
Like, Iapetus, that ridge.

659
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,321
Iapetus, it's like the
equator actually is marked.

660
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,390
When I was a kid, I had a
globe that got messed up,

661
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,458
and the equator
kind of stuck out.

662
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:02,926
I mean that's the
way Iapetus is.

663
00:36:02,926 --> 00:36:04,562
There's this mountain ridge
right along the equator.

664
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:05,663
It's so bizarre.

665
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,038
- [Narrator] This
meeting was only one

666
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:15,973
of several taking place.

667
00:36:17,274 --> 00:36:19,142
It is at this larger gathering

668
00:36:19,142 --> 00:36:21,745
where the proposals
of the tour designers,

669
00:36:21,745 --> 00:36:24,514
representing a year's worth
of work with little time off

670
00:36:24,514 --> 00:36:27,552
for weekends and
holidays, will be judged.

671
00:36:28,418 --> 00:36:30,120
- Compared to the usual agenda,

672
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,556
today is turned upside down.

673
00:36:32,556 --> 00:36:34,524
And the reason for that is,

674
00:36:34,524 --> 00:36:39,530
tour design is the main
topic of this whole meeting.

675
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:45,169
You'll notice that there's
some filming or video going on.

676
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:49,440
This is a JPL activity
to document how

677
00:36:50,373 --> 00:36:52,743
decisions are made on projects.

678
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:55,412
(laughing)

679
00:36:55,412 --> 00:36:59,049
And, well they're gonna have
a cutting and editing process.

680
00:36:59,049 --> 00:37:03,220
So I'm not sure that we'll
recognize it necessarily.

681
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,621
In any case-

682
00:37:04,621 --> 00:37:07,191
- It's like the worst
take-home final ever invented.

683
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:09,026
You have 200 professors,

684
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:11,261
and the hardest questions
you can think of.

685
00:37:11,261 --> 00:37:12,696
And you're just kind
of slogging through it,

686
00:37:12,696 --> 00:37:14,832
trying to get it done,
and then you hand it in.

687
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:19,837
PF7, 11, they're both very
much like six and 6H9.

688
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:22,206
It kind of feels good
to have it handed in,

689
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:23,441
but you're not
really awake enough

690
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:24,875
for really much of
emotion or anything.

691
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:28,179
So you end up with a
Titan flyby at apple axis,

692
00:37:29,379 --> 00:37:32,115
or at periapsis, and
then you come back.

693
00:37:32,115 --> 00:37:33,950
Then you do a pie transfer,
then you crank up again.

694
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:36,653
So there's a lot of
inclined time in this.

695
00:37:36,653 --> 00:37:38,089
And when it comes down-

696
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,890
- [Narrator] From an infinite
number of possibilities,

697
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,759
the tours are
whittled down to nine.

698
00:37:42,759 --> 00:37:44,995
Next, the science
teams are to rank them

699
00:37:44,995 --> 00:37:47,230
as green, acceptable,

700
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:49,700
yellow, partially acceptable,

701
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,069
or red, not acceptable.

702
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:53,704
- [Scientist] But it
sounds like 6H9 and eight

703
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:58,375
should either both be, both
be red or both be yellow.

704
00:37:58,375 --> 00:37:59,976
- [Narrator] But wanting
more wiggle room,

705
00:37:59,976 --> 00:38:04,315
scientists introduce a new
color to the voting, lime.

706
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:09,853
- [Scientist] Okay.

707
00:38:09,853 --> 00:38:13,190
6H9, three greens,
a lime, and a red.

708
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,892
- [Nathan] I mean, it's
kinda like our job was,

709
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:16,460
oh we were just waiting
to hear the result.

710
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,563
I mean, I guess it's kinda
like the jury coming in,

711
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:21,532
but you're too tired to
care what your sentence is.

712
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:23,667
- So you're talking
about PF9 for Titan?

713
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:26,503
- [Narrator] Eventually
a consensus is reached.

714
00:38:26,503 --> 00:38:29,740
(audience applauding)

715
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:34,778
No doubt, the winning tour
has left the scientists

716
00:38:34,778 --> 00:38:38,448
equally happy and unhappy.

717
00:38:38,448 --> 00:38:40,917
The tour designers
are just plain happy.

718
00:38:40,917 --> 00:38:42,485
For the first time in a year,

719
00:38:42,485 --> 00:38:44,888
they will have their lives back.

720
00:38:44,888 --> 00:38:48,959
- It's done. It's over.
The decision's been made.

721
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:51,528
We were happy, but
also just absolutely

722
00:38:51,528 --> 00:38:54,064
felt like a truck
had run over you.

723
00:38:54,064 --> 00:38:57,234
(light hearted music)

724
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:07,778
(dramatic music)

725
00:39:10,647 --> 00:39:12,783
- Hello, this is Arthur Clarke

726
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:17,722
joining you from my home
in Colombo, Sri Lanka.

727
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:21,224
I am delighted to be
part of this event

728
00:39:21,224 --> 00:39:23,861
to mark Cassini's
flyby of Iapetus.

729
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:26,864
- [Narrator] When
science fiction writer,

730
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,765
Arthur C. Clark
wrote the classic,

731
00:39:28,765 --> 00:39:31,068
"2001: A Space Odyssey",

732
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:35,840
he chose for the book's final
scene, Saturn's moon Iapetus.

733
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:38,508
- As you know,

734
00:39:38,508 --> 00:39:41,579
I have more than a passing
interest in Saturn.

735
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:46,617
- [Narrator] In the
movie version of "2001",

736
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:49,219
the ending scene was
changed to Jupiter.

737
00:39:49,219 --> 00:39:53,124
But for Clark, Iapetus remained
a place of deep mystery.

738
00:39:54,591 --> 00:39:58,061
He shared his enthusiasm for
Saturn's third largest moon

739
00:39:58,061 --> 00:40:00,731
with those who gathered
in JPL's auditorium

740
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:04,301
to witness images of Iapetus
as they first arrived.

741
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:07,370
- This is a particularly
exciting moment

742
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:10,707
for fans of "2001:
A Space Oddysey".

743
00:40:10,707 --> 00:40:14,111
Because that's where the
lone astronaut, Dave Bowman

744
00:40:15,145 --> 00:40:17,547
discovers the Saturn monolith,

745
00:40:17,547 --> 00:40:21,518
which turns out to be
a gateway to the stars.

746
00:40:21,518 --> 00:40:24,388
More than 40 years later,
I can't remember why

747
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:26,724
I placed the Saturn
monolith on Iapetus.

748
00:40:28,091 --> 00:40:30,794
But I've always had this
strange fascination with Saturn,

749
00:40:30,794 --> 00:40:33,197
and its family of moons.

750
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:34,698
By the way,

751
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:36,400
that family has been growing
at a very impressive rate.

752
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:42,238
When Cassini was launched,
we knew of only 18 moons.

753
00:40:42,238 --> 00:40:45,742
I understand there's
now 60, and counting.

754
00:40:45,742 --> 00:40:49,013
I can't resist the
temptation to say,

755
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:50,414
my God it's full of moons.

756
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:54,051
So I'm going to keep
my fingers crossed

757
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:57,788
for what Cassini
discovers at Iapetus.

758
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:01,391
I want to thank everyone
associated with this mission.

759
00:41:01,391 --> 00:41:03,827
Science projects are
tremendously important

760
00:41:03,827 --> 00:41:06,630
for understanding
of the solar system.

761
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,797
Who knows?

762
00:41:07,797 --> 00:41:10,934
One day, our survival on Earth

763
00:41:10,934 --> 00:41:13,771
may depend on what we
discover out there.

764
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:19,643
This is Arthur Clarke, wishing
you a successful flyby.

765
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,780
(audience applauding)

766
00:41:30,453 --> 00:41:33,891
- [Narrator] What Cassini saw
at Iapetus was breathtaking.

767
00:41:40,797 --> 00:41:43,233
Many of the observations
focused on examining

768
00:41:43,233 --> 00:41:45,202
a mountain ridge on the equator

769
00:41:46,703 --> 00:41:48,172
that contributes to the moon's

770
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,674
unusual walnut
shaped appearance.

771
00:41:55,378 --> 00:41:58,181
These mountains,
made mostly of ice,

772
00:41:58,181 --> 00:42:01,318
are among the tallest
in the solar system,

773
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:03,487
soaring 12 miles high,

774
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:05,723
more than twice that
of Mount Everest.

775
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:09,092
Scientists have
more than one idea

776
00:42:09,092 --> 00:42:11,061
as to how they may have formed.

777
00:42:12,028 --> 00:42:13,363
- One thought is that perhaps

778
00:42:13,363 --> 00:42:16,166
when Iapetus was more
fluid or pliable,

779
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,468
it was spinning very, very fast.

780
00:42:18,468 --> 00:42:22,038
So it sort of bulged out at
its equator as it was spinning.

781
00:42:22,038 --> 00:42:26,310
And as it cooled off,
then it held that shape,

782
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,879
actually had that mountain
range going around it.

783
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:33,049
- [Narrator] While the
bulge remains to be solved,

784
00:42:33,049 --> 00:42:35,752
scientists believe they
are on more solid ground

785
00:42:35,752 --> 00:42:39,557
as to the reason why Iapetus
is so starkly black and white.

786
00:42:42,225 --> 00:42:44,928
- One of the puzzles going all
the way back to Voyager is,

787
00:42:44,928 --> 00:42:48,631
is that dark material
coming from inside Iapetus?

788
00:42:48,631 --> 00:42:51,067
Maybe some kind of
volcanic eruption?

789
00:42:51,067 --> 00:42:53,102
Or is it coming from outside?

790
00:42:53,102 --> 00:42:55,539
And Cassini solved that puzzle.

791
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:58,342
Turns out that there's
a captured moon, Phoebe,

792
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:00,511
in the outer part of
the Saturn system.

793
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:04,648
Dust from Phoebe comes
in, and gets swept up

794
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:06,917
onto one side of Iapetus,

795
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:10,521
coating that side in almost
a charcoal black material.

796
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:15,992
- [Narrator] This black material
absorbs heat from the sun,

797
00:43:15,992 --> 00:43:18,862
turning the moon's
water ice into a vapor

798
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:21,097
that accumulates like snow

799
00:43:21,097 --> 00:43:23,867
falling on the trailing
side of Iapetus.

800
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:29,773
The result is the moon's
distinct yin and yang veneer.

801
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:42,152
Phoebe, the moon responsible
for Iapetus's dark material,

802
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:45,389
resides on the outskirts
of the Saturnian system.

803
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:51,862
This is a frozen
artifact from the time

804
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:54,397
when the solar
system was forming.

805
00:43:54,397 --> 00:43:57,434
Its battered surface
speaks of a violent past.

806
00:43:58,835 --> 00:44:02,806
Everywhere there are ancient
craters, and landslides.

807
00:44:04,207 --> 00:44:08,712
Phoebe was the first Saturnian
moon Cassini saw up close.

808
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:11,815
And it proved to be a harbinger
of the bounty to come.

809
00:44:13,016 --> 00:44:14,685
For at the time of
Cassini's launch,

810
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:18,088
there were just 18
confirmed Saturnian moons.

811
00:44:19,789 --> 00:44:21,892
Now there are 82.

812
00:44:23,693 --> 00:44:25,896
These moons are as
diverse in shape,

813
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:29,433
size, and composition,
as they are numerous.

814
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:32,969
Battered Mimas, with
its massive crater,

815
00:44:32,969 --> 00:44:36,106
resembles the Death
Star from "Star Wars".

816
00:44:37,607 --> 00:44:40,443
Hyperion resembles a sponge.

817
00:44:40,443 --> 00:44:43,012
Its interior is full of voids,

818
00:44:43,012 --> 00:44:44,781
so much so that it's thought of

819
00:44:44,781 --> 00:44:47,518
more as a rubble pile
than a solid body.

820
00:44:48,618 --> 00:44:51,188
Atlas could be
mistaken for a UFO.

821
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:54,892
Prometheus, a potato.

822
00:44:57,728 --> 00:44:59,863
And Pan, a ravioli.

823
00:45:01,564 --> 00:45:04,934
These and other moons are part
of Saturn's intricate system

824
00:45:04,934 --> 00:45:07,604
that influences the
rings, the magnetosphere,

825
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:09,973
and even the planet.

826
00:45:14,077 --> 00:45:16,746
And while best
known for its rings,

827
00:45:16,746 --> 00:45:19,416
Saturn is deserving
of its own attention.

828
00:45:20,917 --> 00:45:24,088
It is the second largest
planet in the solar system.

829
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:29,526
In volume, Saturn could
hold more than 700 Earths.

830
00:45:34,564 --> 00:45:38,201
Composed mostly of helium
and hydrogen gases,

831
00:45:38,201 --> 00:45:40,571
the planet has no solid surface.

832
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:42,739
Although deep within

833
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:45,509
there is thought to be
a dense core of metals.

834
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:53,016
Despite its size, Saturn
is astonishingly light,

835
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:54,551
less dense than water.

836
00:45:55,952 --> 00:45:59,656
If it could be placed in
an imaginary giant bathtub,

837
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:01,024
Saturn would float.

838
00:46:03,459 --> 00:46:06,597
The planet's spin rate
is also impressive.

839
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:10,267
The Saturn day is only
10 and a half hours long.

840
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,436
This rapid rotation
causes the planet

841
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:16,273
to bulge out at the equator,
and flatten at the poles.

842
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:23,580
Saturn's butterscotch exterior
appears bland and calm.

843
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,549
But this appearance
is deceiving.

844
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:30,587
Beneath the cloud tops is a
churning cauldron of lightning,

845
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:34,557
and wind speeds that can
reach over 1000 miles an hour.

846
00:46:34,557 --> 00:46:36,759
At about every 30 Earth years,

847
00:46:36,759 --> 00:46:39,329
Saturn experiences a mega storm.

848
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:42,099
(dramatic music)

849
00:46:43,266 --> 00:46:46,536
Cassini had the good
timing to witness one.

850
00:46:46,536 --> 00:46:50,640
This raging storm would grow
to encircle the entire planet.

851
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,943
(thunder rolling and
lightening crashing)

852
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:57,414
Even more amazing is what can
be seen at Saturn's poles.

853
00:46:57,414 --> 00:47:00,617
- Saturn has something
unique in the solar system.

854
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:04,587
It has a hexagon
circling the north pole.

855
00:47:04,587 --> 00:47:08,125
It's a six sided jet stream.

856
00:47:10,493 --> 00:47:11,962
You could almost imagine

857
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:14,932
horses on a race track
racing around the hexagon.

858
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:20,436
We don't know why it
keeps its six sided shape.

859
00:47:20,436 --> 00:47:23,840
It's some kind of a wave
pattern that goes around Saturn.

860
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,377
But it's very stable. It's
been there for decades.

861
00:47:27,377 --> 00:47:29,980
It's about two Earth
diameters across.

862
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:34,184
At the very center,
right at the north pole,

863
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,452
there's a giant hurricane.

864
00:47:36,452 --> 00:47:40,123
It's about half the size of
the Continental United States,

865
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:42,158
with wind speeds
about four times

866
00:47:42,158 --> 00:47:43,961
a typical hurricane force wind.

867
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:49,533
- [Narrator] A
second monster storm

868
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,935
was discovered at
Saturn's south pole.

869
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:57,608
It is also ringed with towering
clouds, but lacks a hexagon.

870
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:01,311
And while this vortex
looks like a hurricane,

871
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:03,046
it doesn't behave like one.

872
00:48:04,981 --> 00:48:07,350
These are just some of
the wonders of Saturn

873
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:09,385
witnessed by Cassini.

874
00:48:09,385 --> 00:48:12,522
But still to come is an
entirely different way

875
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:17,127
to explore the planet, as
the spacecraft nears its end.

876
00:48:31,841 --> 00:48:36,847
By 2017, Cassini had circled
Saturn more than 250 times.

877
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:40,783
The mission's achievements
had earned the praise of many,

878
00:48:40,783 --> 00:48:43,954
including the first
human ever to set foot

879
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:46,256
on another celestial body.

880
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:48,425
- Hi, I'm Neil Armstrong.

881
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:51,361
We're here at the
Cincinnati Observatory.

882
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:53,263
- [Narrator] Armstrong
recorded this message

883
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:57,034
to the Cassini team four
years before his passing.

884
00:48:58,534 --> 00:49:02,338
- It has been said,
science is about what is,

885
00:49:02,338 --> 00:49:04,875
and engineering is
about what can BE.

886
00:49:05,975 --> 00:49:08,477
The Cassini-Huygens program has

887
00:49:08,477 --> 00:49:10,314
demonstrated the best of both.

888
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:15,619
And you are the people who
made it the enormous success

889
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,988
that it has been, and is.

890
00:49:19,322 --> 00:49:23,126
Some of you are in
science of what is,

891
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,963
unraveling the secrets
of the Saturnian system.

892
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:29,866
Someone's had a full-time
job just counting moons.

893
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:32,435
The number of your
new discoveries

894
00:49:32,435 --> 00:49:34,104
is nothing short of amazing.

895
00:49:35,504 --> 00:49:39,642
Some of you were in the
what can be category.

896
00:49:39,642 --> 00:49:41,878
You were involved in the
design of the spacecraft,

897
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:46,082
and the trajectories,
system design and operation,

898
00:49:46,082 --> 00:49:49,452
instrumentation, how to
make the measurements,

899
00:49:49,452 --> 00:49:51,188
programming the computers.

900
00:49:52,321 --> 00:49:56,159
We all give you our
very best wishes

901
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:59,362
to continue your
outstanding performance.

902
00:49:59,362 --> 00:50:03,400
Congratulations to each
and every one of you.

903
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:10,573
- [Narrator] Cassini's
original lifetime warranty

904
00:50:10,573 --> 00:50:13,242
was for four years at Saturn.

905
00:50:13,242 --> 00:50:16,379
The mission more than
doubled that guarantee.

906
00:50:16,379 --> 00:50:20,416
In 2017, 20 years
after its launch,

907
00:50:20,416 --> 00:50:25,021
the spacecraft was still
performing beyond expectations.

908
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:27,957
- It's like the spacecraft
just now broke in.

909
00:50:27,957 --> 00:50:30,227
Everything's working
just perfectly.

910
00:50:31,628 --> 00:50:34,197
- [Narrator] Yet Cassini's
days are now numbered.

911
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:36,533
It is running out of fuel.

912
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:39,669
And before that happens, the
spacecraft has to be sent

913
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:42,405
on a course that will
ensure it will not crash

914
00:50:42,405 --> 00:50:45,742
into one of Saturn's moons
that might harbor life.

915
00:50:49,345 --> 00:50:53,249
- Given that Enceladus
now appears to have

916
00:50:53,249 --> 00:50:55,718
all the ingredients
that could harbor life,

917
00:50:55,718 --> 00:50:56,953
we have new rules.

918
00:50:59,055 --> 00:51:01,857
And frankly we have a very
nice home for microbes.

919
00:51:01,857 --> 00:51:04,394
It's room temperature
inside a spacecraft.

920
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:07,697
A hardy microbe could easily
have hitched a ride along.

921
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:09,232
We went through

922
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:11,501
a lot of studies on disposal
options for the spacecraft.

923
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:12,702
Some of them were to take it

924
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:15,705
into very long looping
orbits of Saturn,

925
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:18,374
where it would be stable
for thousands of years.

926
00:51:18,374 --> 00:51:20,776
But the scientific
benefit wasn't there.

927
00:51:20,776 --> 00:51:23,379
We also had options
to go back to Jupiter,

928
00:51:23,379 --> 00:51:26,383
go out to Uranus, go to
the Trojan asteroids.

929
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:28,751
We could have exercised
a lot of those options,

930
00:51:28,751 --> 00:51:31,254
but none of them had
the strength and appeal

931
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:32,889
of a scientific
mission at Saturn.

932
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:34,156
We were built for Saturn.

933
00:51:34,156 --> 00:51:36,826
Saturn was absolutely
just bristling

934
00:51:36,826 --> 00:51:38,895
with things we
hadn't yet explored.

935
00:51:40,062 --> 00:51:41,998
Once we chose to stay,
we had to figure out

936
00:51:41,998 --> 00:51:44,634
how to dispose of the
spacecraft cleanly.

937
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:47,803
- [Narrator] It's decided
to end the mission

938
00:51:47,803 --> 00:51:50,706
by plunging Cassini into Saturn.

939
00:51:50,706 --> 00:51:54,311
But not before attempting
to dive 22 times

940
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:56,812
between the planet
and the rings,

941
00:51:56,812 --> 00:51:59,549
a place no spacecraft
has ever been.

942
00:52:02,151 --> 00:52:05,322
(light hearted music)

943
00:52:18,501 --> 00:52:20,803
- So this is where
Cassini is right now

944
00:52:20,803 --> 00:52:23,840
in its orbit of Saturn,
below the ring plane.

945
00:52:25,241 --> 00:52:29,880
It goes out here, will come
over the top of the rings again,

946
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,047
in a few days.

947
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:33,250
We do this every
seven and a half days.

948
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,684
On April 22nd,

949
00:52:35,818 --> 00:52:38,822
spacecraft will
fly fairly close to

950
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,723
Saturn's big moon, Titan.

951
00:52:40,723 --> 00:52:43,159
And Titan has enough gravitation

952
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:46,963
that we can use it to trade
orbital momentum between

953
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:48,665
Titan going around Saturn,

954
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:51,267
and the spacecraft
going around Saturn.

955
00:52:51,267 --> 00:52:55,438
And with that trade off,
a marvelous thing happens.

956
00:52:55,438 --> 00:53:00,143
The orbit of the spacecraft
jumps inward towards Saturn,

957
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:02,845
so that the next
close fly by of Saturn

958
00:53:02,845 --> 00:53:06,750
will be in between the rings
and Saturn's atmosphere.

959
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:11,520
Is that dangerous?

960
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,623
We don't really
know, but who knows?

961
00:53:13,623 --> 00:53:16,292
We might run into some big
ring particles in there

962
00:53:16,292 --> 00:53:19,929
that we can't see
in our observations.

963
00:53:19,929 --> 00:53:23,633
If that happens, oh well,
it's been a good mission.

964
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:27,270
If it doesn't clobber the
spacecraft right away,

965
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:30,139
then we'll have 22
more flights through

966
00:53:30,139 --> 00:53:32,208
all the way out a million miles.

967
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:34,243
It's a million mile
high roller coaster.

968
00:53:34,243 --> 00:53:35,678
Picture yourself
going click, click,

969
00:53:35,678 --> 00:53:38,247
click, click, click up
a huge roller coaster.

970
00:53:38,247 --> 00:53:41,450
And then starting in,
it's just falling.

971
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:45,855
As we whip through the space
between the rings and planet,

972
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:50,860
we'll be going 120,000
kilometers per hour.

973
00:53:51,594 --> 00:53:54,831
(suspenseful music)

974
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:57,901
(jet engine roaring)

975
00:54:00,203 --> 00:54:02,205
The most important
thing, I think,

976
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:06,443
is the moment when Cassini's
signal reaches the Earth.

977
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:10,279
That means that the
spacecraft has gone through,

978
00:54:10,279 --> 00:54:13,015
I don't know, maybe
1000 different commands,

979
00:54:13,015 --> 00:54:14,283
turning the spacecraft,

980
00:54:14,283 --> 00:54:16,619
operating the cameras
and spectrometers,

981
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:19,522
and dust detectors
and magnetometer.

982
00:54:19,522 --> 00:54:21,290
They make their observation.

983
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:24,693
Spacecraft keeps turning and
twisting to point everything.

984
00:54:24,693 --> 00:54:27,363
And the moment the
signal hits Earth,

985
00:54:27,363 --> 00:54:30,133
we know that all of
that, in the past day,

986
00:54:30,133 --> 00:54:31,800
has been successful.

987
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,303
And I think that's party time.

988
00:54:39,508 --> 00:54:42,378
- [Narrator] But before
there can be party time,

989
00:54:42,378 --> 00:54:46,650
there's the less glamorous work
of creating those commands,

990
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:50,086
and sometimes testing
them in tucked away labs.

991
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:53,622
- I think we're good to go.
- Are we alert?

992
00:54:53,622 --> 00:54:56,993
- Well, this is
another seed kernel.

993
00:54:56,993 --> 00:54:58,495
So after this meeting,

994
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:01,231
I'm gonna have to switch out
this seed kernel for 467.

995
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:03,233
This is 444, right.

996
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:04,466
- Running real time.

997
00:55:04,466 --> 00:55:06,502
'Cause it's synced up
to real space time.

998
00:55:06,502 --> 00:55:08,537
So we just want to leave
it sitting right there.

999
00:55:08,537 --> 00:55:10,472
Kind of a reminder
of when the first.

1000
00:55:10,472 --> 00:55:11,607
- Right.

1001
00:55:11,607 --> 00:55:15,912
So the first ACS
command is at 10:52:38.

1002
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:16,946
Yeah, yeah.

1003
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:18,615
- What we're setting up is,

1004
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:21,684
we're practicing a
main engine maneuver

1005
00:55:21,684 --> 00:55:24,453
we could need in the last
few weeks of the mission.

1006
00:55:24,453 --> 00:55:27,356
So to either come up
out of the atmosphere,

1007
00:55:27,356 --> 00:55:29,459
or go down into the atmosphere.

1008
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:31,994
So actually we're
just simulating

1009
00:55:31,994 --> 00:55:35,598
about a one meter per
second main engine burn.

1010
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:38,601
So the engine's gonna
burn for how many seconds?

1011
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:41,104
- I'm not sure.
- Four or five seconds?

1012
00:55:41,104 --> 00:55:43,139
- Do you remember?
- Joanie?

1013
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:47,277
- Joanie, how long does the
burn last, on one meter?

1014
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:48,444
- About six seconds.

1015
00:55:48,444 --> 00:55:49,378
- Six, okay.

1016
00:55:49,378 --> 00:55:50,847
So what the spacecraft does,

1017
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:53,816
is the spacecraft always
starts from Earth point.

1018
00:55:53,816 --> 00:55:57,553
And it does a roll and
then it does a yaw.

1019
00:55:57,553 --> 00:56:00,222
And then you'll unyaw,

1020
00:56:00,222 --> 00:56:03,192
and then unwind, and
come back to Earth point,

1021
00:56:03,192 --> 00:56:05,495
and then relay all the
data back down to Earth.

1022
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:08,464
We'll be able to, because we're
in the integrated test lab,

1023
00:56:08,464 --> 00:56:10,900
we'll be able to see all
the data in real time.

1024
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,902
So we're actually gonna
call it out in real time,

1025
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:14,504
since we're practicing it.

1026
00:56:15,671 --> 00:56:17,307
- [Interviewer]
What is a SWAMBO?

1027
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:22,211
(laughing)

1028
00:56:22,211 --> 00:56:26,683
- It stands for She Who Always
Must Be Obeyed. (laughing)

1029
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:31,354
- It should take
about 29 minutes.

1030
00:56:31,354 --> 00:56:33,823
- So here it is.

1031
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:35,858
And they're calling
something out right now?

1032
00:56:35,858 --> 00:56:37,126
- Systems?

1033
00:56:37,126 --> 00:56:38,795
- [Luis] Systems.

1034
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:39,696
- Go ahead.

1035
00:56:40,863 --> 00:56:43,333
- The wind roll
turn is complete.

1036
00:56:44,767 --> 00:56:46,736
- The reaction wheels
have powered off.

1037
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:48,705
- [Luis] There it is.

1038
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:49,539
- Here we go.

1039
00:56:51,073 --> 00:56:52,509
Hey, Attitude Control.

1040
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:54,978
- [Joanie] You
weren't listening.

1041
00:56:56,512 --> 00:56:57,947
- I wasn't listening?

1042
00:56:57,947 --> 00:57:00,683
- They said it.
Tina called it out.

1043
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:01,985
- Tina, I can't hear you.

1044
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:03,252
- [Tina] I'm sorry.

1045
00:57:03,252 --> 00:57:05,522
- You and Masashi are
gonna have to speak up.

1046
00:57:06,889 --> 00:57:09,625
You're gonna have to
develop your Julie voice.

1047
00:57:09,625 --> 00:57:11,494
- She was literally
just saying the words,

1048
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:13,262
"Oh, I have to announce",

1049
00:57:13,262 --> 00:57:15,131
when you said "Call
out the burn status".

1050
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:18,201
(all laughing)

1051
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:21,371
(voices overlapping)

1052
00:57:22,538 --> 00:57:25,041
- [Narrator] It is now
more than a month later.

1053
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:27,310
All of the testing
of commands is over.

1054
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:30,179
And on this evening,
team members

1055
00:57:30,179 --> 00:57:32,948
and their families and
friends have gathered to see

1056
00:57:32,948 --> 00:57:35,250
if Cassini will survive
its first plunge

1057
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:36,719
between the rings and Saturn.

1058
00:57:39,021 --> 00:57:41,390
The event has been given a name,

1059
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:44,326
Gateway to the Grand Finale.

1060
00:57:44,326 --> 00:57:46,529
- Well, I just want to
welcome everyone to our

1061
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:49,265
gateway to Cassini's
Grand Finale.

1062
00:57:49,265 --> 00:57:52,368
And this is a
Cassini family event.

1063
00:57:52,368 --> 00:57:55,705
And I'm so happy to
see so many people here

1064
00:57:55,705 --> 00:57:58,007
to share in what's
about to happen tonight.

1065
00:57:59,541 --> 00:58:01,777
- [Narrator] In
1990, Linda Spilker

1066
00:58:01,777 --> 00:58:05,181
stood on this same stage
speaking of Saturn's rings.

1067
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:07,483
- Saturn's rings are
more transitory elements-

1068
00:58:07,483 --> 00:58:09,151
- [Narrator] Now,
three decades later,

1069
00:58:09,151 --> 00:58:11,654
she is Cassini's
project scientist,

1070
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:15,191
and this evening's
master of ceremonies.

1071
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:16,926
- So at midnight tonight,

1072
00:58:16,926 --> 00:58:20,229
will be the first time Cassini
turns back to the Earth,

1073
00:58:20,229 --> 00:58:22,699
sends a signal, and lets us know

1074
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:25,401
that it successfully
navigated through

1075
00:58:25,401 --> 00:58:29,472
this gap where it's flown for
the very, very first time.

1076
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:33,242
So we have a lot in store.
It'll be very exciting.

1077
00:58:33,242 --> 00:58:35,411
- [Narrator] While
awaiting news at midnight,

1078
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:39,415
updates are given on Cassini's
latest science discoveries.

1079
00:58:39,415 --> 00:58:43,685
And a time honored JPL
ritual is acknowledged.

1080
00:58:43,685 --> 00:58:46,155
- Now, I'm not
particularly superstitious.

1081
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:51,093
But you know there's a long
standing JPL tradition.

1082
00:58:51,093 --> 00:58:54,530
So last night, I went
out and I decided

1083
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:59,536
we needed to have some
lucky peanuts, just in case.

1084
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:02,838
And I thought about it
some more and I thought,

1085
00:59:02,838 --> 00:59:07,844
maybe we need two jars (audience
laughing) of lucky peanuts.

1086
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,014
And with that,

1087
00:59:12,014 --> 00:59:14,149
I'd like to introduce the
Cassini Virtual Singers.

1088
00:59:14,149 --> 00:59:16,586
The Virtual Singers
really take the heart

1089
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:20,990
and the soul of Cassini,
and capture it with music.

1090
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:25,962
So tonight, live from JPL
in Pasadena, California,

1091
00:59:28,464 --> 00:59:31,701
just back from their
multi world tour.

1092
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:33,168
(audience laughing)

1093
00:59:33,168 --> 00:59:36,872
We now have the Cassini
Virtual Singers.

1094
00:59:36,872 --> 00:59:40,109
(audience applauding)

1095
00:59:42,611 --> 00:59:45,914

(audience applauding)

1108
01:00:29,491 --> 01:00:32,261
- [Narrator] As the Cassini
Singers take their bows,

1109
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:33,929
flight team members slip away

1110
01:00:33,929 --> 01:00:37,900
to take up their positions on
console in Mission Control.

1111
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,768
- [Molly] I read
you, five by also.

1112
01:00:39,768 --> 01:00:42,138
Power, voice check on FSO chord.

1113
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:46,108
- [Scientist] I read
you five by five.

1114
01:00:46,108 --> 01:00:47,743
- [Molly] I ready
you five by also.

1115
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:49,545
- [Scientist] 10-4.

1116
01:00:49,545 --> 01:00:52,649
(voices overlapping)

1117
01:00:54,383 --> 01:00:56,619
- [Scientist] I read
you, five by five.

1118
01:00:56,619 --> 01:00:59,388
- I read you, five by also.

1119
01:00:59,388 --> 01:01:00,857
Flight Director,
I'm Project Manager.

1120
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:02,091
I'd like to announce
at this time

1121
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:04,193
that all stations
are ready to support.

1122
01:01:05,427 --> 01:01:06,662
- [Scientist] Copy you.

1123
01:01:06,662 --> 01:01:08,398
- [Scientist] Copy
that, thank you.

1124
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:11,167
(dramatic music)

1125
01:01:44,767 --> 01:01:46,335
- Okay, what we're
looking at here

1126
01:01:46,335 --> 01:01:48,003
is the Mission Support Area.

1127
01:01:48,003 --> 01:01:50,039
And they each have
their various stations

1128
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:53,142
looking at different
aspects of the spacecraft.

1129
01:01:53,142 --> 01:01:55,478
And they just went through
a check to make sure

1130
01:01:55,478 --> 01:01:58,747
that everyone can hear
everyone else in the MSA.

1131
01:01:58,747 --> 01:02:02,418
And we also have sound
into that room as well.

1132
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:03,652
So Erick, do you
want to talk about

1133
01:02:03,652 --> 01:02:05,521
what we're seeing on
the screen over here?

1134
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:08,624
- Yeah, so on the left,
that is the signal that

1135
01:02:08,624 --> 01:02:12,194
Deep Space Network is currently
detecting, which is nothing.

1136
01:02:12,194 --> 01:02:14,464
It's just a flat noise
signal right now.

1137
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:18,033
But what we're all going
to be looking for here is

1138
01:02:18,033 --> 01:02:20,936
for a spike to pop
up out of that noise.

1139
01:02:20,936 --> 01:02:22,337
And when we see that spike,

1140
01:02:22,337 --> 01:02:24,941
it means that we're receiving
a signal from Cassini.

1141
01:02:27,776 --> 01:02:30,279
- We have excellent
carrier signal detection

1142
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:32,248
in the auto loop receiver.

1143
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:34,851
(all clapping)

1144
01:02:39,588 --> 01:02:42,759
(audience applauding)

1145
01:02:50,632 --> 01:02:53,535
- That's a nice booming signal.

1146
01:02:53,535 --> 01:02:56,238
So the carrier signal is there.

1147
01:02:56,238 --> 01:02:58,607
We'll have to wait a few
more minutes until that,

1148
01:02:58,607 --> 01:03:00,443
we'll see if there's
actual data flowing.

1149
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,178
But this is a great sign.

1150
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:07,516
- [Narrator] Receiving
back Cassini's carrier tone

1151
01:03:07,516 --> 01:03:10,987
means the spacecraft has
survived the first dive.

1152
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:15,725
- Signal just came booming
through right on time.

1153
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:17,026
Couldn't have been better.

1154
01:03:18,794 --> 01:03:20,763
- [Narrator] Along
with feelings of relief

1155
01:03:20,763 --> 01:03:24,100
is the hope that science
data will soon begin to flow.

1156
01:03:26,201 --> 01:03:28,937
But now comes a
moment of confusion,

1157
01:03:28,937 --> 01:03:31,541
how to best listen
for Cassini's signal.

1158
01:03:32,641 --> 01:03:34,643
- [Ace] Esco
Systems, Cassini Ace.

1159
01:03:34,643 --> 01:03:37,346
The station is
currently looking for

1160
01:03:37,346 --> 01:03:39,915
the X band one-way
carrier signal.

1161
01:03:39,915 --> 01:03:41,517
They're also gonna attempt
to lock up to the AT99-6.

1162
01:03:41,517 --> 01:03:43,886
So stand bye, one. I'll
let you if they get it.

1163
01:03:46,521 --> 01:03:47,957
- Ace, this is Flight Director.

1164
01:03:47,957 --> 01:03:51,661
Don't have them lock
up on the AT99-6.

1165
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:53,729
- [Ace] Okay, you just want
them to look for carrier?

1166
01:03:53,729 --> 01:03:56,065
Esco Systems, Cassini Ace.

1167
01:03:56,065 --> 01:04:00,002
The station has locked up
to the X band one-way signal

1168
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:02,971
at neg 140DB, which is
expected for the AT99-6.

1169
01:04:02,971 --> 01:04:04,807
- That's not good. No.

1170
01:04:06,975 --> 01:04:08,044
- [Esco Systems] Copy.

1171
01:04:10,078 --> 01:04:11,848
- [Nave] Esco
Systems, this is Nav.

1172
01:04:12,781 --> 01:04:14,450
- [Esco Systems] Nav, go ahead.

1173
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:17,353
- [Nav] We're seeing a
one- way Doppler signature.

1174
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:18,321
- [Esco Systems] Copy.

1175
01:04:20,222 --> 01:04:21,523
- [Narrator] The
moment of uncertainty

1176
01:04:21,523 --> 01:04:23,592
ends as quickly as it began.

1177
01:04:23,592 --> 01:04:25,294
And Cassini begins transmitting

1178
01:04:25,294 --> 01:04:27,697
its science data
sooner than expected.

1179
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:32,535
- Flight Director on net.

1180
01:04:33,935 --> 01:04:36,137
Well, we were waiting for 12:05,

1181
01:04:36,137 --> 01:04:38,140
but it looks like we're early.

1182
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:41,811
(all cheering and clapping)

1183
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:52,755
(audience applauding)

1184
01:04:57,659 --> 01:04:58,661
- Oh my God.

1185
01:04:59,995 --> 01:05:01,429
- Well, if there's
any more questions,

1186
01:05:01,429 --> 01:05:02,932
I'd be happy to take questions.

1187
01:05:02,932 --> 01:05:06,334
I mean, this is the big
moment that we waited for.

1188
01:05:06,334 --> 01:05:09,338
And it's here, and it's every
bit as good as we had hoped.

1189
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:12,875
- We're okay for 22 weeks.

1190
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:15,144
We're okay now.

1191
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:20,816
- The spacecraft went
through the ring plane

1192
01:05:20,816 --> 01:05:22,651
just clean as can be.

1193
01:05:22,651 --> 01:05:25,421
There were no indications
of fault protection.

1194
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:26,688
Telemetry data playback

1195
01:05:26,688 --> 01:05:28,457
is exactly where
it's supposed to be.

1196
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:29,959
We can all go home.

1197
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:31,960
We don't want to spend all
night fixing everything up.

1198
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,663
The spacecraft's
in perfect shape.

1199
01:05:43,438 --> 01:05:46,741
- [AECS] System
lead, this is AECS.

1200
01:05:46,741 --> 01:05:48,209
- [System Lead] AECS, go ahead.

1201
01:05:48,209 --> 01:05:50,512
- The downlink roll has started.

1202
01:05:50,512 --> 01:05:52,481
At this time, we
would like to report

1203
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:55,250
that all the initial
conditions checked out.

1204
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:57,719
Initial attitude and
wheel speeds look good.

1205
01:05:57,719 --> 01:05:59,621
All instruments are on.

1206
01:05:59,621 --> 01:06:03,292
The star tracker is tracking
five stars, so that looks good.

1207
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:06,695
Both sun sensors, A
and B, are both on.

1208
01:06:06,695 --> 01:06:09,631
So they match each
other's telemetry.

1209
01:06:09,631 --> 01:06:12,234
At this time, we're
waiting for the roll

1210
01:06:12,234 --> 01:06:14,970
to give us a full
quadrant checkout

1211
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:16,839
for the rest of the pass.

1212
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:18,641
Other than that,
AECS looks great.

1213
01:06:20,242 --> 01:06:21,077
- Copy.

1214
01:06:22,577 --> 01:06:25,213
Flight Director, and Project
Manager. This is Systems Lead.

1215
01:06:25,213 --> 01:06:27,149
All subsystems have reported in

1216
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:28,717
including the sip
lead at this time.

1217
01:06:28,717 --> 01:06:30,619
And everything is nominal.

1218
01:06:30,619 --> 01:06:32,221
- [Earl] Congratulations,
everyone.

1219
01:06:32,221 --> 01:06:34,790
(all clapping)

1220
01:06:49,238 --> 01:06:51,741
(grand music)

1221
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:04,186
- Hello, everyone. I'm
Gay Yee Hill and welcome

1222
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:06,788
to NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.

1223
01:07:06,788 --> 01:07:08,390
After two decades in space,

1224
01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:10,993
NASA's Cassini
spacecraft reached

1225
01:07:10,993 --> 01:07:14,296
the end of its remarkable
journey of exploration.

1226
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:15,865
Today, the spacecraft made

1227
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:18,734
its final approach
to the giant planet,

1228
01:07:18,734 --> 01:07:22,070
and plunged into the
Saturn's upper atmosphere,

1229
01:07:22,070 --> 01:07:24,806
ending this
extraordinary mission.

1230
01:07:24,806 --> 01:07:27,843
But due to the vast
distance between Earth-

1231
01:07:27,843 --> 01:07:31,012
- [Narrator] The Cassini
mission has actually not ended.

1232
01:07:31,012 --> 01:07:31,847
Not yet.

1233
01:07:33,048 --> 01:07:36,051
The grand finale event
is still a week away.

1234
01:07:36,051 --> 01:07:37,953
This is a rehearsal.

1235
01:07:37,953 --> 01:07:41,757
- The sun isn't up
yet, and more than 1500

1236
01:07:41,757 --> 01:07:44,994
Cassini scientists,
engineers, alumni,

1237
01:07:44,994 --> 01:07:46,428
their friends and family,

1238
01:07:46,428 --> 01:07:48,830
have gathered in
Mission Control here,

1239
01:07:48,830 --> 01:07:51,733
Von Karman Auditorium at JPL,

1240
01:07:51,733 --> 01:07:53,335
Beckman Auditorium at Calgary-

1241
01:07:53,335 --> 01:07:54,770
- [Narrator] What's
true for engineers

1242
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:58,274
is also true for JPL's
public communications team.

1243
01:07:59,475 --> 01:08:01,443
A little pre-planning
to work out the kinks

1244
01:08:01,443 --> 01:08:03,446
can be worth its weight in gold.

1245
01:08:03,446 --> 01:08:04,379
- In Australia.

1246
01:08:04,379 --> 01:08:06,982
It's 4:00 am here in California.

1247
01:08:06,982 --> 01:08:09,251
The loss of signal
really happens

1248
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:13,322
at about 3:30 Pacific
time, a half hour ago.

1249
01:08:13,322 --> 01:08:14,690
Why is the team here?

1250
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:16,892
- We thought it'd be over.

1251
01:08:16,892 --> 01:08:18,926
- We will be checking
back with you

1252
01:08:18,926 --> 01:08:21,796
in just a couple more minutes.

1253
01:08:21,796 --> 01:08:24,699
There is a huge crowd
at Beckman Auditorium

1254
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:26,234
at Caltech right now.

1255
01:08:26,234 --> 01:08:29,270
Cassini science team member,
Morgan Cable, is there.

1256
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:31,639
Morgan, what is
it like out there?

1257
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:34,743
- Hi, Gay.

1258
01:08:34,743 --> 01:08:36,578
This is Morgan here at Caltech,

1259
01:08:36,578 --> 01:08:39,048
and the atmosphere is electric.

1260
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:43,085
- I believe we're
going to a bumper.

1261
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:46,654
- And I am one of those
hoping that Cassini will

1262
01:08:46,654 --> 01:08:51,659
hang in there and fight for
the very last seconds of data.

1263
01:08:52,394 --> 01:08:52,895
- What's going on?

1264
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:57,432
- Well, we've just got
the word that Cassini has

1265
01:08:57,432 --> 01:08:59,335
given us its last bit of data.

1266
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:03,337
The room is celebrating.

1267
01:09:03,337 --> 01:09:06,173
Lots of hugs going
on, a few tears.

1268
01:09:06,174 --> 01:09:08,309
- With me now is NASA Director

1269
01:09:08,309 --> 01:09:10,612
of Planetary Science, Jim Green.

1270
01:09:10,612 --> 01:09:12,180
Jim, thanks for joining us.

1271
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:14,884
- You know, Gay, this really
has been a historic mission.

1272
01:09:14,884 --> 01:09:17,018
- Before we do that, let's
take a moment to chat

1273
01:09:17,018 --> 01:09:19,587
with JPL Director, Mike Watkins.

1274
01:09:19,587 --> 01:09:21,022
What's your feeling about

1275
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,657
the success of the
Cassini mission?

1276
01:09:22,657 --> 01:09:24,225
- I could not be more proud

1277
01:09:24,225 --> 01:09:26,594
about the role that we've
had in this mission.

1278
01:09:26,595 --> 01:09:27,863
- With me now is

1279
01:09:27,863 --> 01:09:30,832
Alvaro Genannez,
the ESA Director,

1280
01:09:30,832 --> 01:09:33,167
and the Director of
Science, Roberto,

1281
01:09:33,167 --> 01:09:37,472
ESA Director of Science,
Roberto Battiston.

1282
01:09:39,474 --> 01:09:41,977
Battiston, Battiston.

1283
01:09:41,977 --> 01:09:43,011
- Baggett Battiston.

1284
01:09:43,011 --> 01:09:45,080
(laughing)

1285
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:46,814
- [Narrator] But
all kidding aside,

1286
01:09:46,814 --> 01:09:48,649
the planning paid off.

1287
01:09:48,649 --> 01:09:51,719
For the elaborate multimedia
and interactive coverage

1288
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:55,457
of Cassini's Grand Finale
would be watched by millions.

1289
01:09:55,457 --> 01:09:57,226
- And the Emmy goes to,

1290
01:09:58,994 --> 01:10:02,331
NASA JPL, "Cassini's
Grand Finale".

1291
01:10:03,665 --> 01:10:06,468
- [Narrator] And earned
JPL its first ever Emmy.

1292
01:10:10,839 --> 01:10:13,275
- I got to thank the
stars that that made

1293
01:10:13,275 --> 01:10:15,744
a bunch of geeky
rocket scientists,

1294
01:10:17,112 --> 01:10:19,714
rocket engineers and
scientists, into rock stars.

1295
01:10:19,714 --> 01:10:24,687
(camera clicks)
(audience cheering)

1296
01:10:30,625 --> 01:10:33,662
- [Jonathan] Here's the
Huygens image of the gulley-

1297
01:10:33,662 --> 01:10:36,632
- [Narrator] Less than a week
remains before Cassini's end.

1298
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,402
And team members from around
the world are arriving

1299
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:42,438
to take part in
the Grand Finale.

1300
01:10:43,972 --> 01:10:47,843
This is the final meeting
of the science radar group.

1301
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:50,512
- We've actually been
at this for 40 years.

1302
01:10:50,512 --> 01:10:52,714
This is an image from 1976.

1303
01:10:52,714 --> 01:10:55,550
It's one of Bruce Murray's
purple pigeon projects.

1304
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:58,220
And here's what became
the Huygens probe,

1305
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:01,123
beaming the data to
Cassini, which is flying by.

1306
01:11:02,690 --> 01:11:05,394
That far in time, I
want to make a caveat.

1307
01:11:05,394 --> 01:11:07,529
- [Narrator] As they meet,
a billion miles away,

1308
01:11:07,529 --> 01:11:10,866
Cassini is flying by
Titan for the last time.

1309
01:11:13,334 --> 01:11:16,171
- Right now, Cassini is
flying close to Titan,

1310
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:19,041
74,000 miles away.

1311
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:23,578
And Titan's gravity has
given Cassini its final push,

1312
01:11:23,578 --> 01:11:26,649
its goodbye kiss, and
its fate is sealed.

1313
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:31,853
And toast to a great
spacecraft, a wonderful mission,

1314
01:11:31,853 --> 01:11:34,823
and our final pass by Titan.

1315
01:11:34,823 --> 01:11:37,792
I worked on the Cassini
mission for over 30 years,

1316
01:11:37,792 --> 01:11:39,928
and that's the time
it takes Saturn

1317
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:43,232
to circle the sun a single time.

1318
01:11:43,232 --> 01:11:46,067
And when you work on a mission
for that long of a time,

1319
01:11:46,067 --> 01:11:47,535
and when you work for people,

1320
01:11:47,535 --> 01:11:51,340
many of whom stayed and
were there as long as I was,

1321
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:53,842
you really start to
feel like family.

1322
01:11:53,842 --> 01:11:55,110
You get to know each other.

1323
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:56,811
You take vacations together.

1324
01:11:56,811 --> 01:11:58,880
You attend meetings together.

1325
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,683
You see your families
grow up together.

1326
01:12:01,683 --> 01:12:03,285
And then when the
mission ends, it's hard,

1327
01:12:03,285 --> 01:12:06,154
because you know you'll keep
in touch with this family,

1328
01:12:06,154 --> 01:12:08,223
these people who
feel like friends.

1329
01:12:08,223 --> 01:12:11,026
And yet you also know you'll
go your separate ways.

1330
01:12:11,026 --> 01:12:12,627
- So for the people who
have been with the team

1331
01:12:12,627 --> 01:12:14,562
from the beginning, thank you.

1332
01:12:14,562 --> 01:12:16,131
And I hope you found
that you are now

1333
01:12:16,131 --> 01:12:17,699
30 year wiser and smarter,

1334
01:12:17,699 --> 01:12:20,735
and it has been a
great experience.

1335
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:22,237
But for the people
who joined later,

1336
01:12:22,237 --> 01:12:24,940
hopefully you found that
also a great stepping stone,

1337
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:26,908
and great experience
for you guys

1338
01:12:26,908 --> 01:12:29,077
to lead the future of
planetary exploration.

1339
01:12:29,077 --> 01:12:30,411
So thank you, again.

1340
01:12:30,411 --> 01:12:31,213
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1341
01:12:32,981 --> 01:12:34,950
- Where are the cookies?

1342
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:37,185
- [Narrator] The next
day, Cassini engineers

1343
01:12:37,185 --> 01:12:40,289
gather for their last in
flight operations meeting.

1344
01:12:43,558 --> 01:12:47,429
- 5502 is when we predict
to hit 100% duty cycle.

1345
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:51,066
And AACS predicts loss of
signal 12 seconds after that.

1346
01:12:51,066 --> 01:12:53,001
Navigation, Dwayne.

1347
01:12:53,001 --> 01:12:56,371
- [Dwayne] As of yesterday, at
about 1:30 in the afternoon,

1348
01:12:56,371 --> 01:12:59,041
we had our last Titan flyby.

1349
01:13:00,175 --> 01:13:02,878
And we're on our
way into Saturn now.

1350
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:04,746
- [Chairman] DSN, Mike.

1351
01:13:04,746 --> 01:13:06,614
- So we had seven
passes last week,

1352
01:13:06,614 --> 01:13:11,119
14 command files, including
the last set of builds.

1353
01:13:11,119 --> 01:13:14,155
We have no more
commanding for real time.

1354
01:13:14,155 --> 01:13:15,691
- One-on-one, Jan.

1355
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:17,926
- Okay, the spacecraft's
basically nominal.

1356
01:13:17,926 --> 01:13:20,995
We have no new ISAs,
no other errors.

1357
01:13:20,995 --> 01:13:23,798
And then basically we've
got the end of the sequence.

1358
01:13:23,798 --> 01:13:25,901
We're just clocking out.

1359
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:30,239
Here we are, and knowing that
this is the end, is very sad.

1360
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,640
But knowing in a
mission like Cassini,

1361
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,176
where we had an ending date,

1362
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:38,413
we had a sequence of events to
follow, gave us some purpose.

1363
01:13:38,413 --> 01:13:39,714
All the team stepped up.

1364
01:13:39,714 --> 01:13:41,949
I'm very grateful
for all your support.

1365
01:13:41,949 --> 01:13:43,552
And just want to say, thank you.

1366
01:13:44,686 --> 01:13:45,921
- Does anyone else
have anything?

1367
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:47,456
- Ah, yeah.

1368
01:13:47,456 --> 01:13:49,591
Just because everyone else has
piled on with the thank yous,

1369
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:53,295
you, here in the room,
and out on the phone,

1370
01:13:53,295 --> 01:13:54,797
have rocked the world.

1371
01:13:54,797 --> 01:13:56,965
And this is our last
meeting with the spacecraft.

1372
01:13:56,965 --> 01:13:59,701
But it has just been
an incredible ride.

1373
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:01,135
I am very, very proud

1374
01:14:01,135 --> 01:14:03,705
to have been associated
with all of you.

1375
01:14:03,705 --> 01:14:05,807
And as an incentive
for next meeting,

1376
01:14:05,807 --> 01:14:09,444
when we don't have a spacecraft,
we will bring donuts.

1377
01:14:09,444 --> 01:14:10,479
Thanks, everyone.

1378
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:13,048
(all clapping)

1379
01:14:17,686 --> 01:14:20,789
(voices overlapping)

1380
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:26,061
- And now already,
there's two hours.

1381
01:14:26,061 --> 01:14:27,429
- Two hours.
- Two hours.

1382
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:29,497
- Two hours and counting.

1383
01:14:29,497 --> 01:14:33,868
- It is now 2:55 in the
morning in California.

1384
01:14:33,868 --> 01:14:36,705
We got about two hours
to go until the end.

1385
01:14:37,906 --> 01:14:40,208
Science data on the
recorders are done.

1386
01:14:40,208 --> 01:14:44,078
We're currently in a real
time plunge configuration.

1387
01:14:44,078 --> 01:14:46,381
So everything now is
essentially real time data

1388
01:14:46,381 --> 01:14:49,050
from the instruments, as
we go into the planet.

1389
01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:53,021
The FFTs will begin
to fade and decrease.

1390
01:14:53,021 --> 01:14:54,923
And then, at just one point,

1391
01:14:54,923 --> 01:14:57,626
they'll just disappear entirely
and that'll be the end.

1392
01:14:57,626 --> 01:14:59,194
That'll be the end.

1393
01:15:00,128 --> 01:15:03,298
(contemplative music)

1394
01:15:14,976 --> 01:15:17,478
- Oh, Lord. What
do we got up here?

1395
01:15:17,478 --> 01:15:20,014
It's really hard to end
the mission this way.

1396
01:15:20,014 --> 01:15:21,449
This one's been my companion,

1397
01:15:21,449 --> 01:15:23,919
constant companion,
for 22 years.

1398
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:28,824
My job has always been,
take care of the spacecraft.

1399
01:15:29,957 --> 01:15:31,960
Everything's working
just perfectly.

1400
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:33,694
I mean, you have to
recognize the fact

1401
01:15:33,694 --> 01:15:35,397
that we're out of propellant.

1402
01:15:35,397 --> 01:15:38,667
But I have no idea
how I'm gonna feel.

1403
01:15:42,604 --> 01:15:44,840
- Look, this is
my screen up here.

1404
01:15:46,774 --> 01:15:49,578
So this screen here
is the last 10 minutes

1405
01:15:49,578 --> 01:15:50,945
of the one up at the top.

1406
01:15:50,945 --> 01:15:53,948
The one at the top is
kind of the big picture.

1407
01:15:53,948 --> 01:15:56,918
And this one has
atmosphere models.

1408
01:15:56,918 --> 01:15:58,920
This is also the
last 10 minutes,

1409
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:01,790
but this one does not
have atmosphere models.

1410
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:03,825
So what we're gonna,
what we're hoping to see

1411
01:16:03,825 --> 01:16:06,461
when we get to the very end
and get into the atmosphere,

1412
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:09,498
is this one's gonna start
being different from this one.

1413
01:16:09,498 --> 01:16:11,900
Right now they
look very similar.

1414
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:15,470
Once this one starts
changing from this one,

1415
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:17,772
then we know that we're
in the atmosphere,

1416
01:16:17,772 --> 01:16:20,008
and we're experiencing
drag on the spacecraft.

1417
01:16:20,008 --> 01:16:22,910
- About a minute
before loss of signal.

1418
01:16:22,910 --> 01:16:23,978
The other spot we've got over

1419
01:16:23,978 --> 01:16:25,914
at the attitude control system.

1420
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:28,549
Those charts on the
right of that screen

1421
01:16:28,549 --> 01:16:30,051
are showing thruster activity.

1422
01:16:30,051 --> 01:16:31,319
And we're gonna watch those

1423
01:16:31,319 --> 01:16:33,921
just go right up the
walls, so to speak.

1424
01:16:33,921 --> 01:16:35,390
And again for about a minute.

1425
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:38,392
I mean everything happens
so fast right now.

1426
01:16:38,392 --> 01:16:41,396
- So what we're seeing
is each of these little

1427
01:16:41,396 --> 01:16:43,365
places where the
curve turns around

1428
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:44,866
is where the
thrusters are firing.

1429
01:16:44,866 --> 01:16:47,635
We're trying to control the
orientation of the spacecraft.

1430
01:16:47,635 --> 01:16:49,604
And every time we see a
little change of direction,

1431
01:16:49,604 --> 01:16:51,072
that's a truster pulse.

1432
01:16:51,072 --> 01:16:53,241
And those pulses are getting
more and more frequent.

1433
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:55,209
And the reason for that is
we're getting closer to Saturn,

1434
01:16:55,209 --> 01:16:57,378
and its gravity
gradient is starting

1435
01:16:57,378 --> 01:16:59,881
to rotate the spacecraft around.

1436
01:16:59,881 --> 01:17:01,849
What's gonna happen
is eventually,

1437
01:17:01,849 --> 01:17:03,818
instead of balancing
slowly along the edge,

1438
01:17:03,818 --> 01:17:05,220
it's just gonna be
sitting right on the edge,

1439
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:06,688
firing the thrusters
continuously,

1440
01:17:06,688 --> 01:17:08,423
all the way up to
the point where

1441
01:17:09,490 --> 01:17:10,692
the thrusters are on fully,

1442
01:17:10,692 --> 01:17:12,827
and it can no longer
maintain that attitude.

1443
01:17:12,827 --> 01:17:16,464
And then it'll just drift
outside of our thresholds.

1444
01:17:16,464 --> 01:17:19,134
And then we'll be tumbling,
and that will be the end of it.

1445
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:21,970
(dramatic music)

1446
01:17:23,738 --> 01:17:27,643
- When do we want to tear up
the ceremonial anomaly plan?

1447
01:17:32,948 --> 01:17:35,550
(all clapping)

1448
01:17:38,954 --> 01:17:41,156
- [Scientist] Yes, if you
think of Cassini as a symphony,

1449
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:44,092
this is the final,
final movement.

1450
01:17:44,092 --> 01:17:45,560
There's so many emotions.

1451
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:47,796
I mean, it's such a great
sweet ride it's been.

1452
01:17:47,796 --> 01:17:49,830
It's been a triumph.

1453
01:17:49,830 --> 01:17:51,366
- [Scientist] We are a village.

1454
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:53,267
It has been a
phenomenal teamwork.

1455
01:17:53,267 --> 01:17:56,271
We finish each other's
sentences. We tie
each other's shoes.

1456
01:17:56,271 --> 01:17:59,574
It is absolutely gonna
be something that I will

1457
01:17:59,574 --> 01:18:02,277
never be able to recreate,
and I will miss it greatly.

1458
01:18:06,681 --> 01:18:09,417
- [Narrator] Among those
arriving is Mike Watkins.

1459
01:18:09,417 --> 01:18:12,353
- Wish these were not always
at 3:00 am and 5:00 am.

1460
01:18:12,353 --> 01:18:14,188
- [Scientist] Were you able
to get any sleep before this?

1461
01:18:14,188 --> 01:18:15,657
- Couple hours, a little bit.

1462
01:18:17,092 --> 01:18:20,295
- [Narrator] Watkins is
one year into leading JPL,

1463
01:18:20,295 --> 01:18:23,632
the fourth JPL Director
Cassini has seen.

1464
01:18:25,067 --> 01:18:28,669
(dramatic music)

1465
01:18:28,669 --> 01:18:30,572
- Hello everyone,
I'm Gay Yee Hill.

1466
01:18:30,572 --> 01:18:33,875
And welcome to NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.

1467
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:37,178
After three decades in
space, the Cassini spacecraft

1468
01:18:37,178 --> 01:18:40,649
has reached the end of
its journey at Saturn.

1469
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:43,818
The spacecraft made its final
approach to the giant planet.

1470
01:18:43,818 --> 01:18:47,589
Meanwhile, it is 4:00
am here in California.

1471
01:18:47,589 --> 01:18:49,724
The sun is not up yet,

1472
01:18:49,724 --> 01:18:53,294
and more than 1500
Cassini scientists,

1473
01:18:53,294 --> 01:18:55,663
engineers, alumni,
friends and family

1474
01:18:55,663 --> 01:18:57,765
have gathered for this moment.

1475
01:18:57,765 --> 01:18:59,801
How does it feel,
Todd, to be here?

1476
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:01,702
- Hi, Gay. Well, it's
great to be back.

1477
01:19:01,702 --> 01:19:03,538
As you and I sat there in 2004,

1478
01:19:03,538 --> 01:19:07,342
we never dreamt we'd
be here in 2017,

1479
01:19:07,342 --> 01:19:09,977
still talking about Cassini,
and collecting science data.

1480
01:19:09,977 --> 01:19:12,714
So I'm just thrilled to be here,

1481
01:19:12,714 --> 01:19:16,151
even having aged
some years since SOI.

1482
01:19:16,151 --> 01:19:17,618
- [Systems Lead] Flight
Director, Systems Lead.

1483
01:19:17,618 --> 01:19:18,853
- [Flight Director] Go ahead.

1484
01:19:18,853 --> 01:19:20,187
- [Systems Lead] All
subsystems are nominal.

1485
01:19:20,187 --> 01:19:22,123
We are go for a final plunge.

1486
01:19:22,123 --> 01:19:23,158
- [Flight Director] Copy.

1487
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:30,131
- [Mission Planning] The
spacecraft has just crossed

1488
01:19:30,131 --> 01:19:31,299
40 degrees North latitude

1489
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,402
- [Flight Director]
Copy, thank you.

1490
01:19:34,402 --> 01:19:37,071
- The trajectory is the
very latest trajectory that

1491
01:19:37,071 --> 01:19:40,408
we've reconstructed with the
latest data that we could get.

1492
01:19:40,408 --> 01:19:43,211
So that little dot
here, that's Cassini.

1493
01:19:45,713 --> 01:19:47,382
So it's pretty accurate.

1494
01:19:48,349 --> 01:19:49,317
And, yeah.

1495
01:19:50,284 --> 01:19:51,286
That's cool.

1496
01:19:58,326 --> 01:20:00,128
- [Mission Planning] Systems
Lead, Mission Planning.

1497
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:02,664
- [Systems Lead] Go
ahead, Mission Planning.

1498
01:20:02,664 --> 01:20:04,165
- [Mission Planning]
Spacecraft has just crossed

1499
01:20:04,165 --> 01:20:07,935
30 degrees North latitude,
altitude is 6,000 miles.

1500
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:10,037
[Systems Lead] Copy, thank you.

1501
01:20:10,037 --> 01:20:10,872
- Miles.

1502
01:20:12,707 --> 01:20:15,110
- Yeah, they're calling
out miles. That's weird.

1503
01:20:16,411 --> 01:20:17,212
- Yeah.

1504
01:20:18,346 --> 01:20:20,248
- [Zahi] Yeah, we
usually don't use them.

1505
01:20:20,248 --> 01:20:22,183
- We've never used miles.

1506
01:20:22,183 --> 01:20:25,186
- Well, we are a little
over 10 minutes away

1507
01:20:25,186 --> 01:20:26,755
from the loss of signal.

1508
01:20:26,755 --> 01:20:29,423
So we will be focusing
our attention to

1509
01:20:29,423 --> 01:20:30,991
the control room very soon now.

1510
01:20:30,991 --> 01:20:33,861
But before we do, let's
take a moment to chat

1511
01:20:33,861 --> 01:20:36,664
with JPL Director, Mike Watkins.

1512
01:20:36,664 --> 01:20:39,200
So Mike, how are you feeling?

1513
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:40,901
- Well, first good morning.

1514
01:20:40,901 --> 01:20:42,136
- [Gay] Yeah, a
very early morning.

1515
01:20:42,136 --> 01:20:43,537
- We always tend
to do these events

1516
01:20:43,537 --> 01:20:44,672
somehow at three in the
morning or five in the morning.

1517
01:20:44,672 --> 01:20:46,708
- [Gay] Why do we do that?

1518
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:50,578
But it's kind of a bittersweet
event for all of us, I think.

1519
01:20:50,578 --> 01:20:52,380
For me personally, it's
more sweet than bitter,

1520
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:55,717
because Cassini has been
such a fantastic mission.

1521
01:20:55,717 --> 01:20:58,185
But I think one of the important
things about these events

1522
01:20:58,185 --> 01:21:00,454
is to celebrate the
incredible hard work,

1523
01:21:00,454 --> 01:21:02,257
the decades of hard
work of the team

1524
01:21:02,257 --> 01:21:05,226
that designed, built,
and operated Cassini.

1525
01:21:05,226 --> 01:21:07,095
And that's really, the
heart of the spacecraft

1526
01:21:07,095 --> 01:21:08,796
is really the people
that worked on it,

1527
01:21:08,796 --> 01:21:10,898
and the people that
have been operating it.

1528
01:21:10,898 --> 01:21:13,234
And this is a great
time to celebrate those,

1529
01:21:13,234 --> 01:21:15,770
that level of dedication,
that devotion.

1530
01:21:15,770 --> 01:21:18,239
To work on something
for 10, 20, 30 years,

1531
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:21,443
that's sort of unparalleled
in human history.

1532
01:21:23,811 --> 01:21:26,614
(calm music)

1533
01:21:26,614 --> 01:21:28,616
- [AECS] Systems,
this is AECS one.

1534
01:21:28,616 --> 01:21:30,885
[Systems Lead] Go ahead, AECS.

1535
01:21:30,885 --> 01:21:32,153
- [AECS] We're still
waiting for transition

1536
01:21:32,153 --> 01:21:33,488
to high rate mode,
but it looks like

1537
01:21:33,488 --> 01:21:35,289
we're gonna start
accumulating thruster on time,

1538
01:21:35,289 --> 01:21:37,791
at a higher rate now.

1539
01:21:37,791 --> 01:21:39,393
And our attitude control error

1540
01:21:39,393 --> 01:21:42,597
is starting to be more active.

1541
01:21:43,665 --> 01:21:44,899
[Systems Lead] Copy.

1542
01:21:44,899 --> 01:21:46,901
- [AECS] And we are
in the atmosphere.

1543
01:21:46,901 --> 01:21:48,503
[Systems Lead] Copy, thank you.

1544
01:21:48,503 --> 01:21:51,273
(dramatic music)

1545
01:21:57,378 --> 01:21:59,914
- Here we go.
- Oh yeah, there it is.

1546
01:21:59,914 --> 01:22:03,018
(voices overlapping)

1547
01:22:08,723 --> 01:22:11,559
(dramatic music)

1548
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:38,119
- Flight Director,
Radio Science.

1549
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:40,922
we have loss of signal at
X band, and sierra band.

1550
01:22:46,394 --> 01:22:49,164
(dramatic music)

1551
01:23:00,842 --> 01:23:03,345
(music stops)

1552
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:17,424
- [Flight Director] Project
Manager, Flight Director.

1553
01:23:17,424 --> 01:23:18,926
- [Project Manager] Go ahead.

1554
01:23:18,926 --> 01:23:21,029
- [Flight Director] Okay,
we call loss of signal,

1555
01:23:25,399 --> 01:23:28,903
one one, five five, four
six, for the S-band,

1556
01:23:28,903 --> 01:23:31,006
so that would be the
end of the spacecraft.

1557
01:23:34,174 --> 01:23:36,878
- Project Manager on FSO chord.

1558
01:23:36,878 --> 01:23:40,948
I hope you're all
as deeply proud

1559
01:23:40,948 --> 01:23:43,084
of this amazing accomplishment.

1560
01:23:43,084 --> 01:23:44,985
Congratulations to you all.

1561
01:23:44,985 --> 01:23:46,788
This has been an
incredible mission,

1562
01:23:46,788 --> 01:23:48,723
an incredible spacecraft.

1563
01:23:48,723 --> 01:23:50,925
And you're all an
incredible team.

1564
01:23:52,126 --> 01:23:53,895
I'm gonna call this
the end of mission.

1565
01:23:54,862 --> 01:23:56,798
Project manager off the net.

1566
01:23:59,134 --> 01:24:01,703
(all clapping)

1567
01:24:24,625 --> 01:24:27,896
(contemplative music)

1568
01:24:47,481 --> 01:24:49,984
- My feeling was, I
want to hug somebody,

1569
01:24:49,984 --> 01:24:52,019
and share saying goodbye.

1570
01:24:52,019 --> 01:24:55,256
And that that was hard. It
was hard to say goodbye.

1571
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:57,392
- [Scientist] And seven-four,
if you're listening,

1572
01:24:57,392 --> 01:24:59,594
Project Manager or Program
Manager has confirmed

1573
01:24:59,594 --> 01:25:02,464
end of mission at one
one, five five, four six.

1574
01:25:05,232 --> 01:25:06,467
This concludes Cassini's

1575
01:25:06,467 --> 01:25:08,369
13 year exploration
of the Saturn system.

1576
01:25:09,603 --> 01:25:11,972
- The looks that you
see on people's faces.

1577
01:25:11,972 --> 01:25:14,542
We're not acting. We felt that.

1578
01:25:14,542 --> 01:25:16,811
You're looking at raw
emotion at that point.

1579
01:25:16,811 --> 01:25:18,980
I thought I was gonna
be okay, and I wasn't.

1580
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:22,316
We did it, and it worked.
But it's over. Now what?

1581
01:25:22,316 --> 01:25:23,517
- Been doing this a long time.

1582
01:25:23,517 --> 01:25:25,185
- Yeah. Let's do another one.

1583
01:25:25,185 --> 01:25:26,421
- Yeah, let's do another one.

1584
01:25:26,421 --> 01:25:28,389
(laughing)

1585
01:25:28,389 --> 01:25:31,059
(dramatic music)

1586
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:34,722
(orchestral music)

1587
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:42,430
- [AECS] Maneuver
Lead, this is AECS.

1588
01:26:42,430 --> 01:26:44,265
- [Maneuver Lead]
AECS, go ahead.

1589
01:26:44,265 --> 01:26:48,068
- [AECS] The post burn
unwind roll turn is complete.

1590
01:26:48,068 --> 01:26:49,469
- [Maneuver Lead] Copy, thanks.

1591
01:26:49,469 --> 01:26:51,072
- [Flight Director] FSO chord?

1592
01:26:51,072 --> 01:26:52,306
- [Maneuver Lead] Flight
director, go ahead.

1593
01:26:52,306 --> 01:26:53,374
- [Flight Director]
Yeah, you can go ahead

1594
01:26:53,374 --> 01:26:54,608
and check people off net.

1595
01:26:54,608 --> 01:26:56,977
We'll debrief everybody
in here on the net.

1596
01:26:56,977 --> 01:26:58,912
And we'll walk through
what we need to do,

1597
01:26:58,912 --> 01:27:01,316
including what
happens with the DTUs.

1598
01:27:02,517 --> 01:27:04,318
- [Maneuver Lead] Okay,
copy. Go it, thank you.

1599
01:27:04,318 --> 01:27:06,187
- [Thermal] Maneuver
Lead, this is Thermal.

1600
01:27:07,388 --> 01:27:08,556
- [Maneuver Lead]
Thermal, go ahead.

1601
01:27:08,556 --> 01:27:10,091
- [Thermal] The thermal
devices subsystem

1602
01:27:10,091 --> 01:27:12,126
is nominal, following
on maneuver.

1603
01:27:13,327 --> 01:27:15,363
Requesting permission
to go off to the net.

1604
01:27:16,964 --> 01:27:17,832
- [Maneuver Lead]
Copy. Sounds good.

1605
01:27:17,832 --> 01:27:19,266
Thanks for your support.

1606
01:27:19,266 --> 01:27:20,368
- [Thermal] Copy that.

1607
01:27:22,736 --> 01:27:24,438
- [Maneuver Lead] Com, go ahead.

1608
01:27:24,438 --> 01:27:26,841
- [Com] We would like to
report that telecom is nominal.

1609
01:27:26,841 --> 01:27:28,109
The subsystem is nominal.

1610
01:27:28,109 --> 01:27:30,945
And the Doppler and
telemetry look good.

1611
01:27:30,945 --> 01:27:32,880
So we would request
a sign off the net.

1612
01:27:34,515 --> 01:27:35,416
- [Maneuver Lead]
Copy. Sounds good.

1613
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:37,385
Thanks for your support.

1614
01:27:37,385 --> 01:27:38,419
CDS, Go ahead.

1615
01:27:39,587 --> 01:27:42,890
- Yeah, we note that
the CDS system is

1616
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:45,693
nominal at this time, and
we'd like to sign off the net.

1617
01:27:46,994 --> 01:27:47,828
- [Maneuver Lead] Okay. Copy.

1618
01:27:47,828 --> 01:27:50,031
Thanks for your support.

1619
01:27:50,031 --> 01:27:52,699
- All is nominal,
and I'd like to

1620
01:27:52,699 --> 01:27:54,769
request permission
to get of the net.

1621
01:27:57,704 --> 01:27:59,540
- [Maneuver Lead] Copy, thanks.

1622
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:03,877
- Maneuver Lead, System
Fault Protection.

1623
01:28:03,877 --> 01:28:05,179
- [Maneuver Lead] SFP, go ahead.

1624
01:28:06,047 --> 01:28:06,980
- I can confirm

1625
01:28:06,980 --> 01:28:08,682
no fault protection activity,

1626
01:28:08,682 --> 01:28:12,219
and all telemetry
is per predict,

1627
01:28:12,219 --> 01:28:15,389
as of page 10 on the procedure.

1628
01:28:15,389 --> 01:28:17,859
And SFP would like
permission to go off net.

1629
01:28:19,293 --> 01:28:21,029
- [Maneuver Lead]
Okay, copy. Thank you.

1630
01:28:24,198 --> 01:28:25,633
- Final status for the OTM

1631
01:28:25,633 --> 01:28:27,701
on our side is
about one sigma off.

1632
01:28:27,701 --> 01:28:30,204
Request for signing off.

1633
01:28:30,204 --> 01:28:31,906
- [Maneuver Lead]
Okay, copy. Thank you.

1634
01:28:37,011 --> 01:28:38,078
- [Scientist] I
managed the maneuver,

1635
01:28:38,078 --> 01:28:40,281
and I've done my final queries.

1636
01:28:40,281 --> 01:28:42,083
And it looks like
a nominal burn.

1637
01:28:42,083 --> 01:28:44,886
So I'm requesting permission
to sign off the net.

1638
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:47,354
- [Maneuver Lead] Okay. Copy.

1639
01:28:47,354 --> 01:28:48,323
Thanks for your support.

1640
01:28:51,391 --> 01:28:52,760
- [Prop] Maneuver Lead, Prop.

1641
01:28:54,228 --> 01:28:55,863
- [Maneuver Lead]
Prop, go ahead.

1642
01:28:55,863 --> 01:28:58,599
- Burn time was nailed
within about half a second.

1643
01:28:58,599 --> 01:29:01,369
So it looks like a good RCS
burn, with respect to Prop.

1644
01:29:07,441 --> 01:29:09,310
- Ace, Maneuver
Lead on FSO chord.

1645
01:29:11,946 --> 01:29:14,148
- [Ace] Maneuver Lead, Ace.

1646
01:29:14,148 --> 01:29:16,517
- Yeah, so at this time all
subsystems have reported

1647
01:29:16,517 --> 01:29:19,220
a nominal burn for OTM 469.

1648
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:21,689
So I will be signing
off as Systems Lead.

1649
01:29:23,123 --> 01:29:24,858
- [Ace] Copy that. Thank you.

1650
01:29:24,858 --> 01:29:25,660
- Thank you.

1651
01:29:28,162 --> 01:29:30,498
(calm music)
