1
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:12,512
- [Narrator] Ask someone to
draw a picture of a planet,

2
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:14,681
and odds are it
will be this one.

3
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:19,551
It is the sixth planet
out from the sun

4
00:00:19,585 --> 00:00:22,222
and the second-largest
in our solar system.

5
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,225
It is, of course, Saturn,

6
00:00:26,258 --> 00:00:29,829
a world encircled not
only in majestic rings

7
00:00:29,862 --> 00:00:32,364
but in an array of moons
that have been likened

8
00:00:32,398 --> 00:00:34,567
to a solar system in miniature.

9
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:41,341
(rocket boosters roaring)

10
00:00:43,242 --> 00:00:47,112
In 1997, an international
mission was launched to Saturn

11
00:00:47,146 --> 00:00:49,715
that would, for the first time,

12
00:00:49,748 --> 00:00:53,586
attempt to place an orbiting
spacecraft around the planet

13
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,924
and land a probe on a moon
in the outer solar system.

14
00:00:59,992 --> 00:01:02,161
But this was a
mission that had to

15
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,164
fight its way to the launch pad.

16
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:06,899
- [Lew] We're going
to have to operate

17
00:01:06,932 --> 00:01:08,567
under a very strict
fund ceiling,

18
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:11,270
one that is imposed by Congress.

19
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:13,973
- [Casini] This will
require doing business

20
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:17,510
in a drastically different
way than we've done before.

21
00:01:17,543 --> 00:01:21,381
- [Bob] It took a lotta
time, a lotta negotiating,

22
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,284
a lot of compromises
to make that work.

23
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:27,186
- [Julie] The first time I
saw the spacecraft together

24
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,722
when we stacked without
the blankets, we were just,

25
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,358
we were without words
standing out there.

26
00:01:32,391 --> 00:01:34,160
- [Narrator] The
journey to Saturn

27
00:01:34,193 --> 00:01:36,529
would take seven long years,

28
00:01:36,562 --> 00:01:41,067
but the success, or failure,
of being captured into orbit

29
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,839
depended on what would happen
during just three hours.

30
00:01:47,139 --> 00:01:49,075
- [Charles] The
engine better fire,

31
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:51,644
otherwise we'll
end with a flyby.

32
00:01:51,677 --> 00:01:52,478
- Copy.

33
00:01:52,511 --> 00:01:53,913
DCS Fault Protection.

34
00:01:53,946 --> 00:01:55,982
- [Linda] I think
as a ring scientist,

35
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:58,251
my greatest concern
was really crossing

36
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,520
through that gap in
the F and G rings.

37
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:04,356
It would only have taken
one marble sized particle

38
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,792
in the wrong place
in the spacecraft

39
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:09,329
to perhaps have
ended the mission.

40
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:11,964
- [Man] So I would lie in
bed at night and think about

41
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,166
what other tests should we do?

42
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:16,735
What other question
should I be asking?

43
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:19,706
What should we be poking out
here that we haven't done yet?

44
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,376
- [Julie] We chased
everything that could go wrong

45
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:24,677
down the rabbit hole.

46
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,946
We went down every path
of, if this goes wrong,

47
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:28,147
what do we do?

48
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,782
If that goes wrong,
what do we do?

49
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,350
- [Earl] And this was
one of those moments

50
00:02:31,383 --> 00:02:33,386
where you're either in orbit

51
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,488
or you're a billion
dollar flyby.

52
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:37,590
- [Todd] Closest approach
is just a little over

53
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,025
two minutes away.

54
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:42,661
Predicted temps today,
-226 degrees Fahrenheit,

55
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:44,964
winds of 1100 miles per hour.

56
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:47,733
Hurricanes the
size of the Earth.

57
00:02:47,766 --> 00:02:50,203
Cassini would do well to
batten down the hatches.

58
00:03:14,626 --> 00:03:16,662
- [Narrator] Saturn
was once but a single

59
00:03:16,695 --> 00:03:19,132
bright point of light
in the night sky,

60
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:24,170
but in 1610 Galileo peered
through his telescope

61
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:26,105
and saw something else.

62
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:29,408
On either side of the planet,

63
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,611
he thought there might be moons.

64
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:37,850
Two years later,
Galileo looked again.

65
00:03:39,718 --> 00:03:43,356
To his astonishment, the
two objects had disappeared.

66
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,828
Another two years
passed and Galileo again

67
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,898
trained his telescope on Saturn.

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,636
The puzzling bulges
had returned.

69
00:03:58,737 --> 00:04:01,741
This drawing shows
how close Galileo came

70
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:02,942
to solving the riddle,

71
00:04:04,543 --> 00:04:08,581
but he went to his grave
without ever knowing the answer.

72
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:13,786
A half century would pass
before the Dutch scientist

73
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:17,824
Christiaan Huygens realized
the bulges were rings.

74
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:23,162
As for their appearing
and disappearing,

75
00:04:23,195 --> 00:04:26,599
Huygens realized that was
caused by Saturn's tilting.

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,605
Like Earth, Saturn gently rocks
back and forth on its axis.

77
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:38,844
And when the rings are
viewed from Earth at dawn,

78
00:04:38,877 --> 00:04:40,480
they all but disappear.

79
00:04:42,981 --> 00:04:47,153
As time passed, Saturn
came into closer focus,

80
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:53,225
and in 1979, NASA's
Pioneer 11 spacecraft

81
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,928
gave the world the
first closeup look

82
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:58,631
at the planet and its rings.

83
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:05,137
- We received several
pictures yesterday afternoon

84
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:09,141
and evening, and we'd like to
run through some of those now.

85
00:05:09,174 --> 00:05:11,543
This is the one
that came in here

86
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:14,046
at about three o'clock
yesterday afternoon.

87
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,183
This is by far the most
spectacular picture

88
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,451
that we have so far.

89
00:05:19,718 --> 00:05:21,220
This is raw data.

90
00:05:21,253 --> 00:05:23,356
It has not been
processed in any way.

91
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:28,094
We can see the big banded
planet and, of course,

92
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:31,196
the ring system is very
prominent in this picture.

93
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:35,400
Also prominent is Saturn's
largest moon, Titan,

94
00:05:35,434 --> 00:05:37,036
in the upper right-hand corner.

95
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,943
- [Narrator] The two Voyager
flybys soon followed,

96
00:05:45,711 --> 00:05:49,816
offering even more captivating
views and discoveries.

97
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,220
What these missions
found left scientists

98
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:58,023
clamoring to go again,
and not just to pass by,

99
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:59,792
but to stay.

100
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:04,062
A blueprint and even
some spare parts

101
00:06:04,096 --> 00:06:07,133
for just such an
adventure already existed.

102
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,935
NASA's Galileo mission,

103
00:06:09,968 --> 00:06:13,272
that sent an orbiter
and a probe to Jupiter.

104
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:16,175
Advocates in Europe
and the United States

105
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:19,545
argued for a similar
mission destined for Saturn,

106
00:06:19,578 --> 00:06:22,682
one composed of an
international consortium.

107
00:06:24,483 --> 00:06:27,119
How such a project with
all its complexities

108
00:06:27,152 --> 00:06:29,921
could be done, no
one really knew.

109
00:06:29,955 --> 00:06:34,393
Sorting out roles,
responsibilities, and
especially funding,

110
00:06:34,426 --> 00:06:36,929
took the better
part of a decade.

111
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:42,434
The European Space Agency
offered to build the probe,

112
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:46,705
named Huygens, to land
on Saturn's moon Titan.

113
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,775
The Italian Space Agency
would build the main antenna

114
00:06:49,808 --> 00:06:51,477
and communication system.

115
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:56,014
The spacecraft thrusters
and the main engines

116
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:59,385
would be provided by US
commercial space companies.

117
00:07:01,453 --> 00:07:05,323
And NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory signed on

118
00:07:05,357 --> 00:07:07,293
to build and fly the spacecraft,

119
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:09,962
to be named in honor
of the 17th century

120
00:07:09,995 --> 00:07:13,166
astronomer Giovanni Cassini.

121
00:07:15,267 --> 00:07:19,005
JPL would also provide overall
management of the mission.

122
00:07:20,172 --> 00:07:23,642
In total, 19 countries
would provide hardware,

123
00:07:23,675 --> 00:07:27,446
while scientists would
come from 26 nations.

124
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:28,681
- Good morning.

125
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,516
I wanna welcome
all of you to JPL,

126
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,217
and at the beginning of
what is gonna be clearly

127
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,253
a very exciting mission.

128
00:07:34,286 --> 00:07:36,422
I know that a lot
of you have a...

129
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:37,990
- [Narrator] This is
the first gathering

130
00:07:38,023 --> 00:07:41,293
of Cassini Huygens
scientists and engineers,

131
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:45,097
their goal to transform
this complex partnership

132
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,833
into a functioning team.

133
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:50,902
- Our Congress has had some
agony over the program.

134
00:07:50,936 --> 00:07:53,772
For a time it looked
as though only Cassini

135
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,741
would be approved.

136
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,810
- [Narrator] There are
layers of unease in the room.

137
00:07:58,844 --> 00:08:00,646
The Europeans want to
know that they'll be

138
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:03,182
treated as equal partners.

139
00:08:03,215 --> 00:08:07,119
And there are also concerns
about US reliability,

140
00:08:07,152 --> 00:08:09,555
given that NASA has
recently dropped out

141
00:08:09,588 --> 00:08:11,022
of another partnership.

142
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:12,291
- We're going to have to operate

143
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:13,926
under a very strict
fund ceiling,

144
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:18,564
one that is imposed by Congress
and an unyielding schedule.

145
00:08:18,597 --> 00:08:20,132
And we all have
great challenges-

146
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,700
- [Narrator] NASA
has already warned

147
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:23,269
that the mission
will be canceled

148
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,805
if the project strays
over its budget.

149
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:30,776
All eyes are on Cassini's
first program manager,

150
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:34,446
John Casani, who has already
spoken of eliminating

151
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,749
some of the science instruments.

152
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:39,752
- Seriously like to
welcome everybody.

153
00:08:39,784 --> 00:08:40,985
Nice to be here.

154
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,355
A lot of old friends,
a lot of new faces,

155
00:08:43,388 --> 00:08:45,357
which I hope we'll be
friends before we're through

156
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:47,092
with this process.

157
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,462
But those of you
who don't know me,

158
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:54,500
will find out a lot in
the next couple of years.

159
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:59,404
This will require doing
business in a fairly drastically

160
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,940
different way than
we've done before.

161
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,675
We are all gonna
have to strive for,

162
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,145
as we go through this process,
is a continual search,

163
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,815
as my old friend Gentry
Lee used to like to say,

164
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,550
for the least
unacceptable solution.

165
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,719
There are gonna have
to be compromises.

166
00:09:13,752 --> 00:09:15,521
We wanna work with you.

167
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:18,791
- [Narrator] This was not what
scientists had hoped to hear.

168
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:21,693
- I think this is a
very severe degrade

169
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,395
in the capabilities
of this mission.

170
00:09:23,428 --> 00:09:25,331
- What we did was we
did all of these things

171
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:28,000
to finally get down to
something that we could afford.

172
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:30,269
- That sounds to me like
a very unwise thing to do.

173
00:09:30,302 --> 00:09:33,072
I mean, the essence of this
mission is to get data back.

174
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,408
- [Narrator] The friction
between what scientists want

175
00:09:36,441 --> 00:09:39,512
and what engineers
can do will be a theme

176
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:41,981
running throughout the
lifetime of the mission.

177
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:45,718
So, we'll be deciding
which of Cassini's

178
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:49,221
12 different science
instruments will have priority

179
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,856
at any given time.

180
00:09:52,057 --> 00:09:54,993
First up to plead
his case is the head

181
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:59,098
of the science radar
team, Charles Elachi.

182
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:00,332
- Good morning.

183
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:02,067
I understand from Dennis
that the first speaker

184
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,603
gets everything he asks for.

185
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,275
There is a good thing and a
bad thing about the radar.

186
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:13,478
The good thing is that
for every Saturn orbit,

187
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:15,547
we need to operate
only for one hour.

188
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:18,150
You can have all the rest
of the time, but one hour.

189
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:20,820
The bad thing is that
when we turn it on,

190
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:22,654
the lights on the
spacecraft will dim,

191
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:24,690
you know, it'll go down.

192
00:10:24,723 --> 00:10:27,025
- [Narrator] Representing
the needs of the imaging team

193
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:29,561
is its leader, Carolyn Porco.

194
00:10:29,594 --> 00:10:31,129
- Rates which are
lower than that.

195
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:32,797
After all, we know
what it will take

196
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,100
to image the objects at Saturn,

197
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:36,569
that we know are there.

198
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:39,971
My question is, what is it
that's there that we don't know

199
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:42,841
and we want to have a
very stable platform

200
00:10:42,874 --> 00:10:44,843
and be able to do
long exposures.

201
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,512
These are issues
that ring scientists

202
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,013
stay up late at
night worrying about.

203
00:10:48,046 --> 00:10:49,548
- We are running a
bit behind schedule

204
00:10:49,581 --> 00:10:51,050
so we shall skip
the coffee break,

205
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:54,219
but there is still coffee
for those who can't survive.

206
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:55,720
- [Narrator] One after another,

207
00:10:55,754 --> 00:10:58,524
the science teams take to the
podium to make their pitches

208
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:02,061
and at times to express
their displeasure.

209
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:06,865
- Okay, this is one
of the smaller teams,

210
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:09,802
and I suppose one of
the smaller instruments,

211
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:13,572
although perhaps not as small
as the project might like.

212
00:11:13,605 --> 00:11:17,642
I'm afraid I have to
say that we have to have

213
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,979
an instrument that performs best

214
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,714
within the planetary
environment.

215
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:25,451
So life is not as
simple as perhaps

216
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,319
some people have seen it.

217
00:11:28,553 --> 00:11:31,056
- The other challenge
that we've had here

218
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:34,259
is a recognition over the
past few months that the...

219
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:36,662
- [Narrator] Hoping to
resolve these conflicts,

220
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:39,198
Casani offers up
an unexpected plan

221
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:42,534
to put the scientists
more in control.

222
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:46,972
- We need to incentivize
you to do the best job

223
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:50,208
of making the best estimates
of what it's gonna cost

224
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:51,644
at the time of confirmation.

225
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:54,212
- [Narrator] Instead of
having decisions made

226
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:55,681
from the top down,

227
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:59,051
Casani proposes establishing
a trading system.

228
00:11:59,084 --> 00:12:02,721
Each science team will be given
a defined amount of money,

229
00:12:02,754 --> 00:12:05,590
mass, power and data rates.

230
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:08,059
If later they need
more of anything,

231
00:12:08,093 --> 00:12:10,295
they will have to work
with the other teams

232
00:12:10,328 --> 00:12:12,131
to solve their problem.

233
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:16,335
The scientists agree to this
unusual bartering system.

234
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,937
It is the first major
step in building

235
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,440
a functioning
international team.

236
00:12:21,473 --> 00:12:23,208
- Any questions?

237
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,844
All right, Dennis, thank you.

238
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,001
- [Narrator] By
the fall of 1997,

239
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:51,336
what had once been
just blueprints

240
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,672
are now real pieces of hardware.

241
00:12:55,507 --> 00:12:57,676
For over the last six years,

242
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:01,046
the mission has managed
to survive being canceled,

243
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:03,048
something another
NASA spacecraft

244
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:05,984
meant to rendezvous with
a comet and an asteroid,

245
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,653
was unable to do.

246
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,858
This was part of a new
NASA strategy to cut back

247
00:13:12,891 --> 00:13:15,160
on large and
expensive spacecraft.

248
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:19,164
And there was no
disguising Cassini's size.

249
00:13:19,197 --> 00:13:20,765
It remains, to this day,

250
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,903
the largest US interplanetary
spacecraft ever built.

251
00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:28,140
Standing three stories
tall, when fully loaded,

252
00:13:28,173 --> 00:13:31,343
it will weigh 12 and a
half thousand pounds.

253
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,481
- The first time I saw
the spacecraft together,

254
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,482
when we stacked
without the blankets,

255
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:40,952
I must have stood in the
visitor gallery for 30 minutes.

256
00:13:40,985 --> 00:13:45,090
And it's... I don't
know how to describe it.

257
00:13:45,123 --> 00:13:47,159
It's not yours
anymore, you know.

258
00:13:47,192 --> 00:13:50,462
Even though I had been
intimate with each piece

259
00:13:50,495 --> 00:13:52,564
and part of that spacecraft
and put it together

260
00:13:52,597 --> 00:13:55,166
wire by wire and
in part by part,

261
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,404
to watch it come together as
a whole entity was incredible.

262
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,473
We were without words
standing out there.

263
00:14:03,942 --> 00:14:05,944
- Every now and then
we'll be working in here

264
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,480
and you'll think, wow,
this is going to Saturn

265
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:11,950
and this probe is
gonna land on Titan.

266
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,386
And this is going
somewhere where we've never

267
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:17,590
seen things before and you
get goosebumps from it.

268
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,825
- [Narrator] The spacecraft
has been designed

269
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:23,128
with redundancy as a priority.

270
00:14:23,161 --> 00:14:26,598
Each critical system
has an identical backup.

271
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:30,268
And its advanced software
will allow the spacecraft

272
00:14:30,301 --> 00:14:32,504
at times to fly on its own,

273
00:14:32,537 --> 00:14:35,774
and even self-repair
computer glitches.

274
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:44,383
In Cassini's interior are
some 22,000 wire connections

275
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,620
and more than seven
miles of cabling.

276
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:51,724
- I'm technically an
engineering assistant,

277
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:55,226
and what I do is cabling
for the spacecraft

278
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,162
and I've been doing
it for 20 years.

279
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:04,169
One of the really positive
points about our mechanical team

280
00:15:04,202 --> 00:15:08,407
is that they never say no.

281
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,375
They never seem to tire.

282
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,177
They're always up.

283
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,481
(chuckles) I don't think we
could ask for a better team.

284
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:25,724
- [Narrator] One of
the last assembly tasks

285
00:15:25,757 --> 00:15:30,162
is to cover this bare
spacecraft with blankets.

286
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,334
Using machines more often
used for fine tailoring

287
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,303
than engineering,

288
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:41,373
this reflective material is
cut to protect the spacecraft

289
00:15:41,406 --> 00:15:45,344
early in the mission, when
it flies toward the sun.

290
00:15:48,046 --> 00:15:50,582
This black fabric
will do the opposite,

291
00:15:50,615 --> 00:15:53,952
absorbing and retaining
heat out at Saturn,

292
00:15:53,985 --> 00:15:57,589
where sunlight is only 1%
the strength found at Earth.

293
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,826
The layers will also
provide shielding

294
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,627
from micro meteoroids,

295
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,730
tiny particles of
dust that could damage

296
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:07,833
the spacecraft's electronics.

297
00:16:11,703 --> 00:16:13,172
This is tedious work,

298
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:16,441
cutting, stitching
and fitting hundreds

299
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,978
of individually measured pieces.

300
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:22,747
It is a job made
even more challenging

301
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,116
knowing that this
intricate space quilt,

302
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:27,986
like all of Cassini's
major components,

303
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:30,989
will have to be unmounted
for shipping to Florida,

304
00:16:31,022 --> 00:16:34,159
where everything will
be reassembled again.

305
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:37,462
- We have had less
problem with this

306
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:40,632
than I can remember having
on any other spacecraft.

307
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,167
It's almost scary.

308
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,035
It's just beautiful.

309
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:45,304
No problems.

310
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,106
No major problems anyway.

311
00:16:51,976 --> 00:16:54,613
- [Narrator] While transforming
Cassini from a blueprint

312
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:57,983
into a real spacecraft had
gone exceptionally well,

313
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,587
getting to the final
design had been torturous.

314
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:07,726
Facing budget cuts,
the project was forced

315
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,163
to make another least
unacceptable decision.

316
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,966
Instead of dropping
science instruments,

317
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,536
the spacecraft itself was
scaled back by eliminating

318
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:20,171
the scan platform,

319
00:17:20,204 --> 00:17:23,474
a kind of turntable
required by some instruments

320
00:17:23,508 --> 00:17:25,077
needing motion.

321
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:27,612
Without the platform,
the entire spacecraft

322
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:30,248
will have to rotate
to aim at targets,

323
00:17:30,281 --> 00:17:33,852
resulting also in
less observation time.

324
00:17:33,885 --> 00:17:37,556
But all of the science
instruments have survived.

325
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:52,037
Operations are now
almost complete

326
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,639
for the launch of
Cassini Huygens.

327
00:17:54,672 --> 00:17:57,008
Already on the launch
pad is the Air Force's

328
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,812
heavy lifting Titan 4B

329
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,619
Cassini and the probe
have been reassembled.

330
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:11,022
One of the last
procedures involves

331
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:14,326
loading onto the spacecraft
its power supply,

332
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:17,162
72 pounds of
plutonium encased in

333
00:18:17,195 --> 00:18:21,499
what are called radio isotope
thermoelectric generators,

334
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:25,471
or mercifully called
for short RTGs.

335
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,112
RTGs have been used
on previous missions,

336
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:37,482
but recent nuclear
power plant accidents

337
00:18:37,515 --> 00:18:40,352
and the loss of the
Space Shuttle Challenger

338
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,954
have heightened public
fears of a launch accident

339
00:18:42,987 --> 00:18:44,890
spreading nuclear debris.

340
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,562
Hoping to stop the launch,

341
00:18:51,596 --> 00:18:55,266
anti-nuclear groups
file lawsuits, petition
the White House,

342
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,937
and hold demonstrations at
the Kennedy Space Center.

343
00:19:00,505 --> 00:19:03,441
- Since this is the last public
forum to ensure the public

344
00:19:03,474 --> 00:19:05,476
that everything is
going to be all right,

345
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,978
could you do that one last time

346
00:19:07,011 --> 00:19:09,147
and use your best
argument to persuade,

347
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,082
perhaps, some of your opponents?

348
00:19:11,115 --> 00:19:13,452
- RTGs were designed
for accident conditions.

349
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,786
We've designed them,
we've tested them,

350
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:16,687
we've analyzed for
it, we've gone through

351
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:18,556
a very lengthy review process.

352
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:21,526
And in fact, these
are very safe to use.

353
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:22,894
There's not a risk
to the public,

354
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,663
even if there is an accident.

355
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:27,466
- Would you all confirm
your faith in this mission

356
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:32,003
by telling us how many
family members, kids,

357
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:36,642
and grandkids you have here
watching this launch with you?

358
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,811
- Well, I have 30 members
of my family here right now,

359
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,047
including my two granddaughters.

360
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,549
There's more on the way.

361
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,451
(crowd laughing)

362
00:19:46,484 --> 00:19:48,653
I don't know if I have more
grandchildren on the way,

363
00:19:48,686 --> 00:19:51,856
but I have more
family on the way.

364
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:56,194
The reality is there's no
technology on the horizon

365
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:59,530
that has the promise
to be available

366
00:19:59,564 --> 00:20:02,133
in the foreseeable future at all

367
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:05,203
that could be used
for feigning power

368
00:20:05,236 --> 00:20:06,772
way in outer space,

369
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,708
where there is effectively
very little sunlight.

370
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:14,379
At Saturn, we've got a 1% of
what we have here on Earth.

371
00:20:14,412 --> 00:20:15,913
We know Cassini is safe.

372
00:20:15,947 --> 00:20:20,919
The generator is designed to
be robust in the environments.

373
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,523
We do not rely on success.

374
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,826
We make it compatible
with the environments

375
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:30,695
that might be generated
and it's safe.

376
00:20:30,728 --> 00:20:33,231
I invited everyone I
love to the launch.

377
00:20:33,264 --> 00:20:34,466
- [Man] Will there
be information

378
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:35,901
on the success of
this launch too?

379
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:37,002
- Absolutley.

380
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,572
You can find us with a bottle
of champagne some place.

381
00:20:45,977 --> 00:20:48,780
- [Man] FLC, we have
325 and 326 complete.

382
00:20:48,813 --> 00:20:49,715
Roger.

383
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:57,255
- [Man] EA and LCC
327 and 328 on time.

384
00:20:57,288 --> 00:20:58,890
Roger.

385
00:20:58,923 --> 00:21:00,892
- [Woman] LCC, roger.

386
00:21:00,925 --> 00:21:02,227
- [Man] The Air Force
launch controller

387
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,527
has given a clear to launch.

388
00:21:03,561 --> 00:21:05,596
We've got to go from the range

389
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:08,500
to proceed with the countdown.

390
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,602
- [Woman] Launch
sequence started.

391
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:12,604
- [Man] T minus 10,

392
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:15,340
nine,

393
00:21:15,373 --> 00:21:16,174
eight,

394
00:21:16,207 --> 00:21:17,275
seven,

395
00:21:17,308 --> 00:21:18,510
six,

396
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:19,611
five,

397
00:21:19,644 --> 00:21:20,512
four,

398
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:21,513
three,

399
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:22,681
two,

400
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:23,981
one,

401
00:21:24,015 --> 00:21:26,217
and liftoff of the
Cassini spacecraft

402
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,787
on a billion mile
trek to Saturn.

403
00:21:29,854 --> 00:21:31,356
(cheering)

404
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:33,258
Pitch program is in.

405
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:36,895
(man talking indistinctly)

406
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,799
- [Man] We have
cleared the tower

407
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:43,702
and the Cassini spacecraft
is on its way to Saturn.

408
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,104
T+20 seconds.

409
00:21:46,137 --> 00:21:47,472
All systems are go.

410
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:57,082
Standing by for solid
rocket booster separation.

411
00:22:02,553 --> 00:22:05,991
And the solid rocket boosters
have been jettisoned.

412
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:09,360
- [Man] Item 149 and 150.

413
00:22:09,393 --> 00:22:10,562
- [Man] All systems go.

414
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:28,813
- [Man] All CAS core
stations, ops engineer,

415
00:22:28,846 --> 00:22:31,049
launch vehicle reports
payload fairing jettisoned.

416
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:48,066
- This launch was, for all
practical purposes, perfect.

417
00:22:49,467 --> 00:22:51,603
It was just right on target.

418
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:54,672
And the navigation
corrections that we normally,

419
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,308
routinely expect to have to make

420
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:59,578
for these kinds of
launches was very small.

421
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:01,680
It was an exceptionally
good launch.

422
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:07,886
- [Narrator] But the
launch, as good as it was,

423
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,857
was not powerful enough to send
Cassini directly to Saturn.

424
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:19,597
To get there, mission
designers had long before

425
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:22,633
devised a flight path,
using mother nature

426
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:26,937
to gain extra boosts of
speed by flying by planets,

427
00:23:26,971 --> 00:23:30,008
what are called gravity assists.

428
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:33,711
Cassini's route required two
inward swing bys at Venus,

429
00:23:33,744 --> 00:23:37,182
next back to Earth,
then outward to Jupiter,

430
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,319
and finally on to Saturn.

431
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:44,589
In all, a journey of
over 2 billion miles,

432
00:23:44,622 --> 00:23:47,359
lasting nearly seven years.

433
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:56,101
During the first
Venus encounter,

434
00:23:56,134 --> 00:24:00,004
Cassini grazed just above
the planet's surface,

435
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:04,276
gaining an extra 16,000
miles per hour of speed.

436
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:11,516
- The Cassini spacecraft
has now been in space,

437
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:14,385
in flight, for a little
over eight months.

438
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:16,654
And the performance of
the spacecraft has been

439
00:24:16,687 --> 00:24:18,557
essentially flawless.

440
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,692
Typically on spacecraft like
this, of this complexity,

441
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:25,563
there are issues, complications
of one sort or another,

442
00:24:25,596 --> 00:24:28,833
that we have to work with
some of our ground-based

443
00:24:28,866 --> 00:24:30,335
command capability.

444
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:33,404
For the Cassini spacecraft,
this just hasn't happened.

445
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:35,340
It's a remarkable spacecraft.

446
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,177
- [Narrator] True enough,

447
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:42,981
but Cassini is not yet a
fully complete spacecraft.

448
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:48,953
- We had enough flight
software on board at launch

449
00:24:48,986 --> 00:24:52,156
to be able to fly the
spacecraft, operate
it, navigate it,

450
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,993
and not a whole
lot more than that.

451
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,596
- When we launched,
we had seven years

452
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,999
to get to Saturn and we actually

453
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:06,037
completely changed out the
computer system twice in flight.

454
00:25:07,171 --> 00:25:09,340
We would take the
old computer software

455
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:12,943
and then load up the new
software in the backup computer,

456
00:25:12,977 --> 00:25:14,812
watch it for a while,
make sure it was stable.

457
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:17,315
And then we would swap
and make the backup

458
00:25:17,348 --> 00:25:18,282
the prime computer.

459
00:25:18,315 --> 00:25:20,418
Make sure it was stable.

460
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:22,854
- [Narrator] As engineers
worked on completing

461
00:25:22,887 --> 00:25:26,157
Cassini's software,
scientists started lobbying

462
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,692
to begin using their instruments

463
00:25:27,725 --> 00:25:30,729
far ahead of the
agreed upon schedule.

464
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,898
- The cartoon.

465
00:25:33,931 --> 00:25:35,266
You gotta see the cartoon.

466
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,768
You gotta see the whole thing.

467
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:40,338
So the idle spacecraft is
the devil's playground.

468
00:25:41,372 --> 00:25:42,606
For the first three years,

469
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,608
we weren't supposed
to do anything.

470
00:25:44,642 --> 00:25:46,911
We were supposed to fly a rock.

471
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:50,115
And we were just
gonna go take this,

472
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:53,418
take the spacecraft,
correct it engineering wise,

473
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:56,120
fly it by Venus, a
couple of times by Earth,

474
00:25:56,153 --> 00:25:58,489
and we really weren't
gonna do much science.

475
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:00,591
And here were the
scientists saying,

476
00:26:00,624 --> 00:26:02,327
"You've got this
great spacecraft,

477
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,162
everything's working on it,
you don't have to check...

478
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:06,864
You know, you don't have
to redo your thermal.

479
00:26:06,897 --> 00:26:08,933
You don't have to redo this.

480
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,735
Let's do science."

481
00:26:11,936 --> 00:26:16,674
And so I came in one day
and this was on my door.

482
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:19,110
The idle spacecraft is
the devil's playground.

483
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:23,981
I swore for years that
one of the scientists

484
00:26:24,014 --> 00:26:25,583
had put that on my door.

485
00:26:25,616 --> 00:26:26,918
It was my boss.

486
00:26:26,951 --> 00:26:28,553
He put that on my door.

487
00:26:37,428 --> 00:26:38,596
- [Narrator] For the most part,

488
00:26:38,629 --> 00:26:40,865
the scientists
were accommodated,

489
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:42,900
but the project's
priority was first

490
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,136
getting safely past the Earth,

491
00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:48,206
which occurred in
the summer of 1999,

492
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:52,243
giving Cassini another 12,000
miles per hour of speed.

493
00:26:58,182 --> 00:27:01,752
The next milestones were
passing beyond the orbit of Mars

494
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,755
and the region of
the asteroid belt.

495
00:27:11,562 --> 00:27:13,064
Then came Jupiter,

496
00:27:14,098 --> 00:27:16,601
where Cassini saw raging storms,

497
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:18,637
some centuries old.

498
00:27:20,037 --> 00:27:24,008
Cassini also teamed up with the
venerable Galileo spacecraft

499
00:27:24,041 --> 00:27:27,178
to jointly measure
Jupiter's magnetosphere,

500
00:27:27,211 --> 00:27:29,780
a bubble of charged
particles trapped

501
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,517
within the planet's
magnetic field.

502
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:37,689
At closest approach,
Cassini took this image.

503
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:42,260
At that time, the most detailed
view of Jupiter ever seen.

504
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,042
The Jupiter encounter served
as a full dress rehearsal

505
00:27:58,075 --> 00:27:59,711
for what awaited at Saturn.

506
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:02,514
It revealed there
was work to be done

507
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:05,717
in addressing Cassini's
design compromise.

508
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,619
The lack of the scan platform
that would have allowed

509
00:28:08,652 --> 00:28:11,222
simultaneous use of
science instruments,

510
00:28:11,255 --> 00:28:14,826
needing either to move
or to be rock steady.

511
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:18,830
- It meant you had to
turn the spacecraft

512
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,766
every time you wanted to
point an instrument someplace.

513
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:24,569
And we had 12 instruments,

514
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:27,205
and each instrument
generally had

515
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:30,241
different pointing
druthers, if not in fact,

516
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:32,643
hard and fast
pointing requirements.

517
00:28:32,676 --> 00:28:35,346
And so there was an
awful lot of negotiation

518
00:28:35,379 --> 00:28:38,282
that went on between the
different science teams,

519
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:41,285
the different instrument
representatives,

520
00:28:41,318 --> 00:28:43,454
in deciding who was
gonna get to control

521
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:45,890
the pointing of the
spacecraft when.

522
00:28:45,923 --> 00:28:49,327
It took a lot of time,
a lot of negotiating,

523
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,130
a lot of compromises
to make that work.

524
00:28:55,733 --> 00:28:57,368
- [Narrator] Despite
this restraint,

525
00:28:57,401 --> 00:29:00,238
Cassini could now boast
of being the most capable

526
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:03,241
interplanetary
spacecraft ever sent out

527
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:04,709
into the solar system.

528
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,365
After a journey of
nearly seven years,

529
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:31,835
Cassini and the Huygens probe
are nearing Saturn's doorstep.

530
00:29:31,869 --> 00:29:34,805
Whether two decades
of dreaming, planning,

531
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:38,176
building, and undertaking
this arduous journey

532
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:41,679
will be rewarded,
will soon be known.

533
00:29:41,712 --> 00:29:44,849
For just ahead is the
most dangerous moment

534
00:29:44,882 --> 00:29:47,018
that Cassini will face.

535
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:48,853
SOI.

536
00:29:48,886 --> 00:29:50,889
Saturn Orbit Insertion.

537
00:29:53,824 --> 00:29:57,795
No one is more excited, or
anxious, about this moment

538
00:29:57,828 --> 00:29:59,964
than Charles Elachi.

539
00:29:59,997 --> 00:30:02,666
In addition to still
being the team lead

540
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,868
for Cassini's radar experiment,

541
00:30:04,902 --> 00:30:06,571
he now heads JPL.

542
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:10,508
- Cassini is probably one of
the most exciting missions

543
00:30:10,541 --> 00:30:15,547
ever undertaken by the US
and it deserves more credit.

544
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:19,149
So when we come to
the orbit insertion,

545
00:30:19,183 --> 00:30:21,652
after advocating
for it, selling it,

546
00:30:21,685 --> 00:30:24,688
building it and flying it,

547
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:27,625
it was a really very
sobering moment.

548
00:30:29,226 --> 00:30:33,832
The engine better
fire, otherwise we'll
end with a fly by.

549
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:38,302
You have to remember that
we had the Mars Observer,

550
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,439
where when we turned on the
engine, the thing disappeared.

551
00:30:44,107 --> 00:30:45,977
- [Narrator] 11 years before,

552
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,646
as Mars Observer was
approaching Mars,

553
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:51,315
the spacecraft was
commanded to pressurize

554
00:30:51,348 --> 00:30:52,851
its propulsion system.

555
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:57,422
The spacecraft was
never heard from again.

556
00:31:00,224 --> 00:31:03,527
It's believed a massive rupture
in the fuel lines occurred,

557
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:07,465
putting the spacecraft
into an unrecoverable spin.

558
00:31:12,603 --> 00:31:14,505
We have about 15, 20 minutes.

559
00:31:14,538 --> 00:31:17,175
This is Bob Mitchell, who
is the project manager.

560
00:31:18,609 --> 00:31:20,911
- Okay, well, I think
we've got what'll be

561
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:23,447
a rather interesting
program laid out here

562
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,715
for you this evening.

563
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:27,384
Certainly gonna have
a little drama to it.

564
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:32,257
I was kinda confident, but
I was worried, concerned.

565
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:36,261
Nervous might be the
best word as well.

566
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:43,501
- [Narrator] To slow down
enough to be captured

567
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:45,102
by Saturn's gravity,

568
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:48,640
Cassini will have to turn
on its seldom used engine

569
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:50,908
for 96 minutes.

570
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:54,145
Anything less could result
in flying past the planet,

571
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:56,514
never to return.

572
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:03,855
The flight path will take
Cassini and the probe

573
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:08,226
up through and back down
a gap in Saturn's rings.

574
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,060
There's worry that
there could be particles

575
00:32:10,093 --> 00:32:12,396
in these regions large
enough to damage,

576
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:16,233
or even destroy, the spacecraft.

577
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,002
- I think as a ring scientist,

578
00:32:18,035 --> 00:32:21,071
my greatest concern was really
crossing through that gap

579
00:32:21,104 --> 00:32:23,074
in the F and G rings.

580
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:26,910
It would only have taken
one marble sized particle

581
00:32:26,944 --> 00:32:28,879
in the wrong place
in the spacecraft

582
00:32:28,912 --> 00:32:30,681
to perhaps have
ended the mission.

583
00:32:30,714 --> 00:32:33,651
So for me, the most,
you know, breathtaking,

584
00:32:33,684 --> 00:32:35,519
the heart stopping
time, was really

585
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:37,255
crossing through the ring plane.

586
00:32:39,089 --> 00:32:40,858
- [Narrator] To reduce the risk,

587
00:32:40,891 --> 00:32:44,161
Cassini will fly through the
gaps with its high gain antenna

588
00:32:44,194 --> 00:32:47,498
facing forward to
act as a shield.

589
00:32:47,531 --> 00:32:50,300
During these times, the only
signal coming back to Earth

590
00:32:50,334 --> 00:32:55,005
will be from a smaller antenna
transmitting a single tone.

591
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,242
The pitch, or frequency,
of the tone will vary

592
00:32:58,275 --> 00:33:01,145
with changes to the
spacecraft's speed.

593
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:03,381
What's known as
the Doppler effect.

594
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:07,852
This will tell engineers how
the spacecraft is performing...

595
00:33:08,852 --> 00:33:10,354
or not.

596
00:33:10,387 --> 00:33:12,790
- Zero is the
reference frequency,

597
00:33:12,823 --> 00:33:14,959
the nominal frequency
that we would see

598
00:33:14,992 --> 00:33:16,593
if there were no burn.

599
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:18,229
So if the motor never ignited,

600
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:20,430
what would happen
is this line up here

601
00:33:20,464 --> 00:33:22,967
would just go right
straight across.

602
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,735
I would lie in bed at
night and think about

603
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:27,304
what other tests should we do?

604
00:33:27,337 --> 00:33:29,840
What other question
should I be asking?

605
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:32,743
What should we be poking at
here that we haven't done yet?

606
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:35,580
And this corner right
here corresponds to

607
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:37,448
where the burn should end.

608
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:40,684
There wasn't any single
thing that I could point to

609
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:42,653
and say that thing right there

610
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,889
has a fair chance of biting us.

611
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:46,690
There just wasn't
anything like that.

612
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:51,129
But when you consider all the
things that had to happen...

613
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:53,330
or not happen,

614
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:56,634
there were enough of them
that the aggregate of them

615
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,569
was cause for being nervous.

616
00:33:58,602 --> 00:33:59,803
And I was.

617
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:03,141
That would be cause for
some level of concern.

618
00:34:09,612 --> 00:34:13,784
- [Julie] SOI was such a,
just such a team effort.

619
00:34:14,985 --> 00:34:16,754
We chased everything
that could go wrong

620
00:34:16,786 --> 00:34:18,021
down the rabbit hole.

621
00:34:18,054 --> 00:34:20,290
We went down every path
of, if this goes wrong,

622
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:21,458
what do we do?

623
00:34:21,491 --> 00:34:23,293
If that goes wrong,
what do we do?

624
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:28,332
There were 10,000 tests run to
put together that insertion.

625
00:34:32,835 --> 00:34:35,004
- Something we've
been preparing for

626
00:34:35,038 --> 00:34:38,542
for four or five years,
testing and testing,

627
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:41,946
awfulizing all of the possible
things that could go wrong.

628
00:34:41,978 --> 00:34:45,581
And this was one of those
moments where you're either

629
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:48,319
in orbit or you're a
billion dollar fly by.

630
00:34:56,793 --> 00:34:59,363
- Things continue to go well
in Cassini mission control.

631
00:34:59,396 --> 00:35:02,934
We're approximately 33
minutes from burn start.

632
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:05,136
There's our flight
director, Julie Webster.

633
00:35:06,603 --> 00:35:09,573
This is one person we hope
to not hear from tonight.

634
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:13,377
This is system fault protection
engineer, Paula Morgan.

635
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,346
And if we hear from
fault protection,

636
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:18,049
that means we've had some sort
of anomaly on the spacecraft.

637
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:21,184
Doug Johnson, our radio
science and SOI communicator.

638
00:35:21,218 --> 00:35:23,821
He's the one reporting most of
the events we'll see tonight

639
00:35:23,854 --> 00:35:25,256
through that Doppler signal.

640
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,426
- [Narrator] Also on
console is Jan Berkeley.

641
00:35:29,459 --> 00:35:32,729
She first worked at JPL
as a college intern.

642
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:36,133
Now she's a key member
of the Cassini team

643
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:38,502
that creates the computer
sequence commands

644
00:35:38,535 --> 00:35:40,938
that operate the spacecraft.

645
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,706
- We would run them,
make sure that there were

646
00:35:42,739 --> 00:35:44,208
no problems with that.

647
00:35:44,241 --> 00:35:46,643
If we needed to do testing,
we would schedule testing.

648
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:49,212
We were the ones that actually
sent them to the spacecraft.

649
00:35:49,246 --> 00:35:51,048
And then we watched
them clock out.

650
00:35:51,081 --> 00:35:53,384
That was the tense moment,
was not pushing the button,

651
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,987
it was waiting for it to
come back, that it worked.

652
00:35:57,388 --> 00:36:00,690
And Saturn was so far away
that it would take three hours

653
00:36:00,724 --> 00:36:02,493
just to get there and come back.

654
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,729
- Current speed of the
Cassini spacecraft:

655
00:36:05,762 --> 00:36:08,165
22.2 kilometers per second,

656
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:10,701
which is just under
50,000 miles an hour.

657
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:14,104
And increasing as Saturn's
gravity draws us in.

658
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:17,908
That's Shin Huh, our
SOI systems engineer.

659
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:21,512
Shin has eaten, breathed,
slept, and lived SOI

660
00:36:21,545 --> 00:36:23,080
for many years.

661
00:36:23,113 --> 00:36:25,549
Tonight is his big night.

662
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:28,018
- All stations on
that SOI systems.

663
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:29,820
Just an advisory, we're
coming up on the time

664
00:36:29,853 --> 00:36:32,089
for the critical sequence
will initiate the turn

665
00:36:32,122 --> 00:36:33,624
to the SOI burn attitude.

666
00:36:33,657 --> 00:36:38,396
The burn command will be sent
at 7:35:35 PM local time.

667
00:36:40,363 --> 00:36:41,865
Flight director, SOI systems,

668
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:44,668
all subsystems report the
spacecraft data is nominal

669
00:36:44,701 --> 00:36:46,637
and ready to support SOI.

670
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,905
- [Man] Okay, I copy that.

671
00:36:59,182 --> 00:37:00,851
SOI, comms flight director...

672
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:03,187
- [Todd] We're waiting.

673
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,055
- Copy telecomm

674
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:20,571
A JPL tradition has begun,

675
00:37:20,604 --> 00:37:22,740
starting in the back of
the Mission Support Area.

676
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:26,444
This is the consuming of
the lucky JPL peanuts.

677
00:37:34,618 --> 00:37:36,754
Doug Johnson just
reported a signal,

678
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:38,422
we've survived the
ring plane crossing

679
00:37:38,455 --> 00:37:40,124
through the F and G rings.

680
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:42,393
(applause)

681
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:49,133
One hurdle down, one to go,
with the start of the burn

682
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,334
a meer nine minutes away.

683
00:37:51,368 --> 00:37:54,171
- [Julie] ACE flight
director on FSL court.

684
00:37:54,204 --> 00:37:57,341
Are you still tracking
Canberra on B2?

685
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:01,311
- [Man] That's affirmative.

686
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:03,748
- Let's go ahead and switch
Canberra over to B-Zero.

687
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:11,488
Go ahead, NAV-1.

688
00:38:11,521 --> 00:38:13,524
- [Man] We can confirm
that we are receiving

689
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:14,892
one way data from the DSN.

690
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,962
- [Julie] One way
Doppler from DSS14?

691
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:20,865
- [Man] Yes, that's affirmative.

692
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,702
- Navigation can also
confirm we're receiving

693
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:27,204
the Doppler data.

694
00:38:27,237 --> 00:38:29,206
We've been able to
verify that the turn

695
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,442
to the SY burn
attitude is complete.

696
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:35,612
We're approaching two
minutes before the SOI burn.

697
00:38:35,645 --> 00:38:38,349
Hopes and dreams of
thousands of scientists

698
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:41,651
and engineers are resting
on the next few moments.

699
00:38:41,685 --> 00:38:43,887
So Godspeed, Cassini Huygens.

700
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,122
May we see you in orbit.

701
00:38:46,456 --> 00:38:47,558
- We're gonna drop in.

702
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,295
- On the Doppler display,
what we're looking for

703
00:38:51,328 --> 00:38:54,298
is a turning of the corner
to start to follow that line

704
00:38:54,331 --> 00:38:56,199
down to the lower right.

705
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:58,469
And that's our indication
the burn has begun.

706
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:03,974
Flight, SOI comms..

707
00:39:04,007 --> 00:39:05,442
- [Julie] Go ahead.

708
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:07,778
- [Man] We have a Doppler
signature consistent

709
00:39:07,811 --> 00:39:09,713
with engine turn on.

710
00:39:09,746 --> 00:39:12,883
(cheers and applause)

711
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:22,827
- [Todd] Lots of high
fives and celebrations

712
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,828
in mission control.

713
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:31,602
Congratulations all of you
that have worked so hard

714
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:32,470
for this moment.

715
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:40,644
One minute down, about
96 minutes to go.

716
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:47,818
We're continuing to follow
the nominal predicted curve

717
00:39:47,851 --> 00:39:48,785
on the Doppler.

718
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:49,953
So the fact we turned the corner

719
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:51,188
means the engine has started.

720
00:39:51,221 --> 00:39:52,656
The fact that we're
following the line

721
00:39:52,689 --> 00:39:54,291
means we're getting the right
thrust out of the engine.

722
00:39:54,324 --> 00:39:57,328
So more good news for the
Cassini Huygens spacecraft.

723
00:40:06,903 --> 00:40:07,838
- Way to go.

724
00:40:07,871 --> 00:40:09,306
Way to go.

725
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,975
- [Narrator] There's now
90 minutes of waiting

726
00:40:12,008 --> 00:40:14,912
until Cassini's engine
is to stop firing.

727
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:18,315
The lull in the action
affords a rare opportunity

728
00:40:18,348 --> 00:40:20,817
to give members of
Congress who are on hand

729
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:23,721
a very up close
and personal tour.

730
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,869
It's a moment to witness
history in the making,

731
00:40:39,903 --> 00:40:42,172
and, as politicians well-know,

732
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:45,242
to take advantage of
an excellent photo op.

733
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:54,518
- It's 7:42 PM in NASA's
Cassini mission control.

734
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,523
The next thing we'll look
for is an occultation

735
00:40:59,556 --> 00:41:03,560
by the A ring around 8:05
PM Pacific time local.

736
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:06,163
At that time, we'll
see an increased noise

737
00:41:06,196 --> 00:41:07,697
in the Doppler signal,

738
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:11,035
similar to the increased
noise there at the far left

739
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:12,402
of the Doppler plot.

740
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:15,272
And our final scary
moment of the evening

741
00:41:15,305 --> 00:41:17,842
will be to make sure to
get the burn shut down.

742
00:41:19,309 --> 00:41:22,480
The history making day for
JPL, NASA, and the world.

743
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,117
- [Man] Flight, SOI comm.

744
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,685
- Go ahead, SOI comm.

745
00:41:28,718 --> 00:41:31,855
- [Man] We have hit
the A ring pretty hard.

746
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,623
- All right.

747
00:41:33,656 --> 00:41:36,059
- [Todd] More good news
from SOI Comm there,

748
00:41:36,092 --> 00:41:39,062
the frightening looking
change to our Doppler data

749
00:41:39,095 --> 00:41:40,764
is totally anticipated.

750
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:42,966
This proves that Saturn's A
ring is where we think it is.

751
00:41:42,999 --> 00:41:46,971
And the Cassini spacecraft is
where we think it is as well.

752
00:41:48,705 --> 00:41:52,275
- [Man] We're continuing to
track a two to three DB signal

753
00:41:52,308 --> 00:41:55,211
with occasional outages
through the A ring.

754
00:41:55,245 --> 00:41:56,413
And we expect to see
a nice strong signal,

755
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:58,749
we have the main
division coming up.

756
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:00,251
- [Julie] Copy
that, sounds good.

757
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:05,756
(phone ringing)

758
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:08,425
- [Todd] As we see, we're
approaching the B ring,

759
00:42:09,893 --> 00:42:12,196
and we must remember tonight,
everything happening at Saturn

760
00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:14,298
occurred an hour and
24 minutes earlier

761
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:17,868
due to that pesky speed of
light, 186,000 miles per second,

762
00:42:17,901 --> 00:42:20,403
our interplanetary speed
limit, if you will.

763
00:42:20,436 --> 00:42:22,072
- [Julie] Go ahead SOI Comm.

764
00:42:22,105 --> 00:42:24,240
- [Man] After a brief
peak up to 11DB,

765
00:42:24,274 --> 00:42:27,477
we have now exited the division.

766
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,478
- Copy.

767
00:42:28,511 --> 00:42:30,848
- [Man] What just happened?

768
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,783
- They just announced
that we are now

769
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:35,986
a captured object around Saturn.

770
00:42:36,019 --> 00:42:38,255
We are now an
orbit... an orbiter.

771
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:42,226
- First in history
around Saturn.

772
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:43,360
- There you go.

773
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,229
First man-made
orbiter around Saturn.

774
00:42:46,429 --> 00:42:48,432
Voyager, eat your heart out.

775
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:52,369
- [Man] SOI systems,
this is contingency.

776
00:42:54,003 --> 00:42:56,907
- Closest approach is just a
little over two minutes away.

777
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,676
And given that, it's
probably about time

778
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:02,412
for our Saturnian
weather forecast.

779
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:06,283
Predicted temps today,
-226 degrees Fahrenheit

780
00:43:06,316 --> 00:43:09,185
or -143 degrees Celsius.

781
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:12,556
Winds of 1100 miles
per hour or so.

782
00:43:12,589 --> 00:43:16,960
Chance of helium rain
inside the interior, 100%.

783
00:43:16,993 --> 00:43:19,496
Hurricanes the
size of the Earth.

784
00:43:19,529 --> 00:43:22,166
Cassini would do well to
batten down the hatches.

785
00:43:24,167 --> 00:43:27,270
Closest approach is
upon us with a speed

786
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:29,706
of almost 69,000 miles per hour.

787
00:43:29,739 --> 00:43:32,209
And the speed HAS
started slowing.

788
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:03,873
- [Man] Flight, SOI Comm.

789
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:05,142
- [Julie] Go ahead, SOI Comm.

790
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:08,278
- [Man] The Doppler
has flattened out.

791
00:44:08,311 --> 00:44:11,448
(cheers and applause)

792
00:44:11,481 --> 00:44:14,551
(indistinct chatter)

793
00:44:19,355 --> 00:44:21,858
- [Todd] Okay, we have
burn complete here,

794
00:44:21,891 --> 00:44:23,527
for the SOI orbit
insertion burn.

795
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:31,200
Congratulations continue
in mission control.

796
00:44:31,234 --> 00:44:33,069
The high-fives begin in the back

797
00:44:33,102 --> 00:44:34,505
of our mission support area.

798
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:46,083
I'm just hearing a
report from radio...

799
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,153
- You did great.

800
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,422
You did great.
- Thank you.

801
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:52,689
- My pleasure.

802
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:55,926
Here's to our lucky
propulsion engineers.

803
00:44:56,826 --> 00:44:57,994
Did a wonderful job tonight.

804
00:44:58,027 --> 00:45:00,229
- Knowing that it
survived and was there

805
00:45:00,263 --> 00:45:01,798
and we were ready to, you know,

806
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:04,835
get to the meat of the science
and get these great images.

807
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:05,902
It was a wonderful moment.

808
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:07,237
The voyage begins.

809
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:08,772
We made it, like, we did it.

810
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,544
- Fantastic job.

811
00:45:14,578 --> 00:45:16,580
- Now we're gonna
put your ECAP in.

812
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:18,882
(laughing)

813
00:45:20,383 --> 00:45:22,819
- [Todd] I was just
informed by my management,

814
00:45:22,852 --> 00:45:25,288
she'll put my performance
evaluation in.

815
00:45:25,322 --> 00:45:27,624
I'm glad she waited until
our success tonight.

816
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:30,561
It's alive.

817
00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:31,729
- It's alive.

818
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:49,113
(gentle music)

819
00:45:52,415 --> 00:45:54,617
- So there's this
amazing elation

820
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:57,654
and then almost
immediately a crash,

821
00:45:57,687 --> 00:46:00,890
just because we're
exhausted and tired,

822
00:46:00,923 --> 00:46:02,425
but I couldn't sleep.

823
00:46:02,458 --> 00:46:04,627
And so I stayed in the MSA,

824
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:09,499
and the images of the
rings were playing back,

825
00:46:09,532 --> 00:46:14,037
and slowly people started to
gather around these images,

826
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:16,706
which no one had
seen close up images

827
00:46:16,739 --> 00:46:18,742
flying right over the
tops of the rings.

828
00:46:20,376 --> 00:46:24,280
And there were just goosebumps.

829
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:26,183
That's a memory I
will never forget.

830
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:32,022
- This is way more
ringlets, little pieces.

831
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:34,057
- [Narrator] Until now,
the mission has been

832
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:36,393
mostly the province
of engineers.

833
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:40,130
With these first ever closeup
images of Saturn's rings,

834
00:46:40,163 --> 00:46:43,399
the shift to science
begins in earnest,

835
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:46,969
and there are hints of
major discoveries ahead

836
00:46:47,003 --> 00:46:48,739
from what already can be seen.

837
00:46:49,906 --> 00:46:52,676
- I don't think you have
to be a ring scientist

838
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:55,245
to imagine what last
night was for us.

839
00:46:55,278 --> 00:46:57,981
It was beyond
description really.

840
00:46:58,014 --> 00:46:59,549
It was mind blowing.

841
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02,119
It was every adjective
you could think of.

842
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:05,721
I'm surprised at how
surprised I am at the beauty

843
00:47:05,755 --> 00:47:07,223
and the clarity of these images.

844
00:47:07,256 --> 00:47:09,425
They are shocking to me.

845
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:12,929
The spacecraft allows us
a very steady platform.

846
00:47:12,962 --> 00:47:16,833
This machine, you turn it, you
point it, and it stays there.

847
00:47:16,866 --> 00:47:19,102
It's like a tripod in space.

848
00:47:19,135 --> 00:47:22,039
Anyway, I think ring scientists
are gonna have a field day.

849
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:23,473
So thank you.

850
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:27,544
Wow.

851
00:47:27,577 --> 00:47:29,813
(applause)

852
00:47:38,988 --> 00:47:41,124
- [Narrator] Cassini's
arrival coincided

853
00:47:41,157 --> 00:47:44,761
with a time when the planet
was well lit by sunlight,

854
00:47:44,794 --> 00:47:48,198
providing extraordinary
views of the rings.

855
00:47:49,632 --> 00:47:53,704
Saturn, plus the rings, span
about a quarter million miles,

856
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:57,107
and they would fit in between
the Earth and its moon.

857
00:47:58,307 --> 00:48:00,777
And yet for all of
its wide expanse,

858
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:03,880
the rings themselves
are paper thin,

859
00:48:03,913 --> 00:48:07,150
only about 10 feet thick.

860
00:48:08,317 --> 00:48:10,720
If you could scoop up
all the ring particles,

861
00:48:10,753 --> 00:48:13,623
there would be less mass
than one of Saturn's

862
00:48:13,656 --> 00:48:15,225
small moons named Mimas.

863
00:48:18,928 --> 00:48:20,230
- [Narrator] From a distance,

864
00:48:20,263 --> 00:48:23,099
the rings cast off
a sense of serenity,

865
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:26,937
but they are as complex and
chaotic as they are beautiful.

866
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:29,872
For they are made up
of countless numbers

867
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:33,377
of disorderly objects of
different sizes and shapes.

868
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:40,350
This is a simulated image
based on radar observations,

869
00:48:40,383 --> 00:48:43,553
showing particles sizes
found in different regions

870
00:48:43,586 --> 00:48:44,921
of the rings.

871
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:47,223
The color purple
represents where there is

872
00:48:47,256 --> 00:48:50,460
a preponderance of objects
smaller than two inches.

873
00:48:50,493 --> 00:48:54,297
Particles in green are
about an inch in size.

874
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:56,833
The blueish bands
are still smaller.

875
00:48:58,301 --> 00:49:01,738
The white bands are dense
regions that radio signals

876
00:49:01,771 --> 00:49:03,273
were unable to penetrate.

877
00:49:05,608 --> 00:49:08,812
This false color image
highlights what can be seen

878
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:10,013
in the ultraviolet.

879
00:49:11,247 --> 00:49:13,951
The turquoise colors
represent water ice.

880
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:17,487
The red colors are a
different kind of particle.

881
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,623
Uncertain as to
what it might be,

882
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:22,592
the scientists decided
to name it dirt.

883
00:49:23,793 --> 00:49:25,796
- Cassini was also
able to measure

884
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:28,265
the temperature of
the ring particles,

885
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:31,768
and the rings that had
the most dirt or pollution

886
00:49:31,801 --> 00:49:36,573
were slightly warmer than
the bright icy rings.

887
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:38,508
- [Narrator] And,
despite being made of

888
00:49:38,541 --> 00:49:40,710
mostly cosmic dust and ice,

889
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:45,048
the rings contained some
structures as large as a house.

890
00:49:45,081 --> 00:49:48,585
And as scientists discovered
to their astonishment,

891
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:51,355
even transitory mountains.

892
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:54,491
- There is a unique moment
in the Cassini mission

893
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:56,960
where the sun was
edge onto the rings,

894
00:49:56,993 --> 00:49:59,762
and that allowed us to see
anything that would stick up

895
00:49:59,795 --> 00:50:03,934
above or below those
10 feet thick rings.

896
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:07,971
Then lo and behold, we found
what looked like mountains

897
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:11,307
casting huge shadows
on the rings.

898
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:13,643
And it turns out that
the rings of Saturn

899
00:50:13,676 --> 00:50:15,679
are not like just
individual particles,

900
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:18,948
but a lot of these
particles stick together

901
00:50:18,982 --> 00:50:22,585
and grow into larger
and larger particles.

902
00:50:22,618 --> 00:50:25,421
But these clumps of
particles are ephemeral.

903
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:27,591
They don't last for a long time.

904
00:50:27,624 --> 00:50:32,396
They can be broken up and then
reformed in to new particles.

905
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:39,936
- [Narrator] Saturn's
moons and smaller moonlets

906
00:50:39,969 --> 00:50:41,471
also influenced the rings.

907
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:47,476
Even orbiting rubble
piles hold a kind of sway.

908
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:50,346
Altogether, they help
shape the boundaries

909
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,915
of Saturn's rings,

910
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:54,550
herding in particles
that might otherwise

911
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:56,753
rain down in a
torrent on the planet

912
00:50:56,786 --> 00:50:59,389
or escape into deep space.

913
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:04,460
Meanwhile, particles from
some of Saturn's moons

914
00:51:04,493 --> 00:51:06,529
are constantly shedding off,

915
00:51:06,562 --> 00:51:11,535
helping to preserve existing
rings or creating new ones.

916
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:20,276
Among the unexpected
discoveries within the rings

917
00:51:20,309 --> 00:51:22,879
were these propeller
like objects.

918
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:28,184
- Propellers are these largest
clumps of ring particles,

919
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:30,286
and they get big
enough so their gravity

920
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:33,890
wants to push apart the
rings and open up a gap.

921
00:51:33,923 --> 00:51:35,358
And then there's not
quite enough gravity

922
00:51:35,391 --> 00:51:36,593
to open it up all the way.

923
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:38,694
And so you see these
little propellers

924
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:40,096
sprinkled throughout the rings,

925
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:42,232
especially in Saturn's A ring.

926
00:51:44,467 --> 00:51:47,170
- [Narrator] A mystery
dating back to Voyager

927
00:51:47,203 --> 00:51:51,240
was the appearing and
disappearing of ghostly spokes.

928
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:54,144
Cassini determined their cause.

929
00:51:54,177 --> 00:51:57,347
Electrostatic charges that
lift up dust particles,

930
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:00,383
where they levitate for
a time above the rings.

931
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:06,889
There remain two
fundamental questions

932
00:52:06,922 --> 00:52:09,225
lacking definitive answers.

933
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:12,129
The first is knowing how
the rings came to be.

934
00:52:13,496 --> 00:52:17,000
- So many things about the
rings are unexplained even now.

935
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:21,170
There are a lot of ideas
for how Saturn's rings

936
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:22,839
initially formed.

937
00:52:22,872 --> 00:52:25,975
One of those is that
perhaps the rings formed

938
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:28,645
from the material
that was left over

939
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:30,213
from when Saturn formed.

940
00:52:30,246 --> 00:52:33,449
So if that's true,
then the rings are old,

941
00:52:33,482 --> 00:52:35,252
as old as Saturn itself.

942
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:40,256
Other ideas: say perhaps
an object may be a comet,

943
00:52:40,289 --> 00:52:43,059
or a meteor, came in
too close to Saturn,

944
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:46,028
was torn apart by
Saturn's gravity,

945
00:52:46,061 --> 00:52:48,531
and then created the rings.

946
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:51,801
Or perhaps a moon wandered
too close to Saturn

947
00:52:51,834 --> 00:52:53,536
and was torn apart.

948
00:52:53,569 --> 00:52:57,006
And so then the rains could
be as young as maybe only 10

949
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,276
or a hundred million years old.

950
00:53:01,544 --> 00:53:04,947
- [Narrator] Along
with determining the
origin of the rings,

951
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:08,785
understanding their fate is
also an unanswered question.

952
00:53:09,919 --> 00:53:12,488
But the adage that
nothing lasts forever

953
00:53:12,521 --> 00:53:14,891
likely applies even to them.

954
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:20,129
- As micro meteoroids
continue to bombard the rings,

955
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:23,399
and some of the innermost
particles fall into Saturn

956
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:25,568
and actually water the planet,

957
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:28,671
the rings are getting lighter
and lighter with time.

958
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:31,774
And so perhaps in another
few hundred million years,

959
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:34,144
Saturn's rings as we
know it might be gone.

960
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:36,646
Maybe we'll be left
with narrow rings

961
00:53:36,679 --> 00:53:38,949
like we see in
the Uranus system.

962
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:43,352
- [Narrator] And one
day long from now,

963
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:47,590
Saturn's glorious rings
might disappear altogether.

964
00:53:47,623 --> 00:53:50,727
One more reason to
enjoy them while we can.

965
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:01,337
Next time on "JPL
and the Space Age",

966
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:05,141
Part Two of "Triumph
at Saturn"...

967
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:09,913
With Cassini safely in orbit,
science takes center stage,

968
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:14,651
beginning with the dramatic
descent of the Huygens Probe

969
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:17,887
to the surface of
Saturn's moon Titan.

970
00:54:19,054 --> 00:54:20,457
- [Man] We knew Titan
was a tough target,

971
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:23,025
was going to hold
its secrets tightly.

972
00:54:23,058 --> 00:54:25,829
And so we designed
this mission to hit it

973
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:27,797
with everything we've got.

974
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:29,565
- [Narrator] In the
years that follow,

975
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,269
one unexpected discovery
after another will be made,

976
00:54:33,302 --> 00:54:35,504
earning this
international mission

977
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:37,874
accolades from around the world.

978
00:54:39,008 --> 00:54:41,310
- Science is about what is,

979
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:44,847
and engineering is
about what can BE.

980
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,050
The Cassini-Huygens
program has demonstrated

981
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:49,585
the best of both.

982
00:54:49,618 --> 00:54:51,888
The number of your
new discoveries

983
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:54,190
is nothing short of amazing.

984
00:54:54,223 --> 00:54:56,525
- [Woman] I would say
Cassini's discoveries

985
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:01,197
fundamentally altered the way
we look at our solar system.

986
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:04,200
Around one planet,
we find two moons

987
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:07,436
that could potentially
be habitable,

988
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:11,374
have the key ingredients
to support life.

989
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:14,577
- I have more than a
passing interest in Saturn

990
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:16,046
and its family of moons.

991
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:20,883
When Cassini was launched,
we knew only 18 moons.

992
00:55:20,916 --> 00:55:24,620
I understand there's
now 60 and counting.

993
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:27,523
I can't resist the
temptation to say,

994
00:55:27,556 --> 00:55:29,426
my God, it's full of moons.

995
00:55:30,826 --> 00:55:35,465
- [Narrator] "Triumph at
Saturn" Part Two, next time.

996
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:48,378
(gentle music)
